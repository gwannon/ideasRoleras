## The enigma of the Ape Peninsula

&nbsp;

\conc

_Deep in the Caribbean lies a peninsula surrounded by water on all sides, called the Ape Peninsula. Venture into its dark grottoes, dense jungles, and well-stocked gift and souvenir shops to become a true buccaneer._

_You'll have to face zombie ships, vampire pirate captains, talking shrunken heads, and plenty of apes, using your intelligence, your wit, and the powerful, sometimes explosive, magic of voodoo._

_If you're lucky enough to avoid scurvy, you might just survive this adventure and find the greatest pirate treasure ever known, Mac'n Cheese, earning the respect of the entire Caribbean._

«The enigma of the Ape Peninsula» is a graphic adventure game for EGA, released on three 3.5-inch floppy disks. Its genre is humor and fantasy, and it was developed by LucasArts Games. This chapter comprises only the first of the three disks that make up the complete campaign.

### Diskette #1: How to Be a Pirate

Your PCs have just arrived in Bucan Ville, a pirate haven, with the intention of becoming pirates and making a fortune through piracy.

This part is divided into four scenes. The first is a brief introduction. Then there are two parallel scenes: one in which the Pirate Bosses grant them the title of pirate after they pass a test, and another in which they acquire a ship and its flag. The fourth scene is the heist of the governor's safe.

#### 1. Start

The player characters appear at nightfall in the port of Bucan Ville and shout, «My name is [player character name] and I want to be a pirate!».

##### Harbour

In this filthy, shabby harbour, there's only one place to go: the _**Boiled Crab Tavern**_, a pirate den where the grog is watered down and the snacks and peanuts were once Blackbeard's cabin boys.

In the distance, you can see a _**ship with tattered black sails**_. A ghostly glow floods its deck, and flocks of bats circle overhead.

From the port, you can access the _**Bucan Ville Town Center**_.

#### The Boiled Crab Tavern

The place is a dingy, old dive, packed with _**drunken pirates**_. The few who aren't passed out can barely manage a sentence:

* So you want to be a pirate, huh? Talk to the three _**Pirate Bosses**_.

\sp

* The grog of my day was real grog, not like the stuff they make now with little umbrellas, cloves, and mint leaves. We used to put real cloves in it.
* Have you heard of [Arrr! Cthulhu](https://arrrcthulhu.com/), an excellent setting for pirate adventures in a Caribbean of the Cthulhu Mythos?
* They stole my idea for the ape-trafficlights. I could have been a millionaire and retired to a Caribbean island and spent my days drinking grog. Oops, I already do that.

At a large table in the back sit the _**3 Pirate Bosses**_. The most powerful pirates of Bucan Ville, chosen by the democratic method of slaughtering all their competition.

These three rude pirates are at the table, swigging grog and singing bawdy songs. When your players explain that they want to be pirates, they'll laugh a lot and tell them to stop wasting their time and go back to what they were doing. Your players will have to prove they really want to be pirates by answering questions like these.

* What was Blackbeard's flag? - A horned skeleton holding an hourglass in its right hand and a spear in its left, using the spear to pierce a red heart that drips three drops of red blood.
* What was the name of Blackbeard's first ship? - Queen Anne's Revenge.
* What was Stede Bonnet's nickname? - Gentleman Pirate

They'll also be made to sing «Yo Ho Ho And a Bottle of Rum» (which your players will have to sing). After a while trying to prove they deserve a test, they'll agree to take the Pirate Guild's standardized exam, which consists of two tests:

* You must prove you're on the other side of the law.
* You must own your own self-propelled watercraft and create its unique, personalized pirate flag.

After explaining the standardized tests, they'll be made to sign some paperwork and given a __**discount voucher**_ for the _**Souvenir Shop**_. If they ask for any hints, they'll just be told to ask for Sam at the shipyard to see what ships they can offer.

On the table of the three _**Pirate Bosses**_, there's a fruit bowl with oranges, bananas, apples, Swiss vitamin C candies, and lemons, which they say are from their anti-scurvy campaign. If they ask, they can take a _**piece of fruit**_. Choose one at random and give it to them. If they eat it, they can ask for another. Until they finish it, the _**Pirate Bosses**_ will tell them to finish the other fruit they took first.

#### 2.a Going over to the other side of the law

As the _**Pirate Bosses**_ have explained, to become a pirate you need to be on the other side of the law, or have proof of it.

There are several ways to commit crimes:

* The easiest way is to run the red light at the _**ape-trafficlights**_ in Bucan Ville's _**Main square**_.
* Another way is to stand to the left of the _**courthouse**_ and ask the _**painter**_ in the _**Main square**_ for help.

\sp

* If they attempt other types of crimes, your characters will look at the screen and say things like, «My mother didn't raise a petty thief» or «This would get me in trouble with Santa Claus».

If they seem lost at this point, emphasize the «other side of the law» or remind them of the drunken pirate at the _**Boiled Crab Tavern**_ who claimed to have invented the ape-trafficlights and ask them for a clue.

##### Bucan Ville Center

The downtown streets are deserted at night, the gas lamps are lit, and the shops are closed—all except the _**souvenir shop**_ with its large neon sign that reads «Open 24 Hours».

To cross the street that runs through the center, you have to go through a pedestrian crossing controlled by a _**ape-trafficlights**_ and watched over by a _**city guard**_ who only says, «Move along, move along!» The monkey-traffic light is operated by a monkey that changes the color of the light by moving levers. When you approach, the monkey moves the levers, and you always cross on green.

No matter how hard you try, the monkey always sets it to green. The only way to cross on red is to give the monkey a banana when the light is red, and as it eats the banana, it stays red. At that moment you can cross and the _**city guard**_ will give you a _**fine**_ and, therefore, you will be an outlaw.

##### Bucan Ville Main square

The Main square is like all plazas, a large, empty cobblestone space with a single _**withered tree**_ in the center bearing a sign that reads «Tree for Hanging Pirates - Closed for Renovations».

In the center of the plaza, a _**painter**_ is busy painting the town hall. He paints the pictures at lightning speed and leaves them in a _**pile**_ beside him. If you examine them closely, you'll see they aren't very good.

If you try to talk to him, he'll tell you he's very busy; he has to paint 1,000 identical pictures of the town hall for the fundraising campaign for the governor's reelection.

Next to the town hall is the _**courthouse**_. As you approach, you'll see that it's open from midnight to midnight, except on weekends when it's closed. If they stand to the left of the painter before he starts a new painting and wait until he finishes, they can pick up a painting where they are next to the courthouse—that is, on the other side of the law, as the _**Pirate Bosses**_ requested.

On the other side of the town hall, they can access a _**dark alley**_ from which random snippets of a conversation emerge.

##### Dark alley

It's just a distraction. When they enter, the voices will fall silent and figures will vanish into the shadows. As soon as they step back out into the plaza, the voices will return.

\sp

#### 2.b Get a pirate ship and flag

The only place on the island that sells boats is the _**Shipyard**_, and the only thing your players can afford right now is a rowboat. The problem is, it's not self-propelled, so they'll have to find a way to build a sail for it.

For the sail fabric, they just need to get the _**Twister vinyl**_ from the _**Souvenir Shop**_. The mast will simply be one of the oars, and they'll have to tell their idea to Sam, the Shipyard Manager.

They might waste pixels converting non-clickable elements into clickable ones, like carpets, sheets, etc. When they take it to _**Sam**_, he'll give them some silly excuse.

If they present the title deed of the rowboat to the _**Pirate Bosses**_ without a sail, they'll fail the test, shouting in unison, «It's not self-propelled!»

The flag isn't a challenge; let them use whatever they find to make their flag, and if you can, make it as ridiculous as possible. They can use the _**discount voucher**_ at the _**Souvenir Shop**_, and the clerk can give them any silly thing you can think of to use for their flag.

##### Shipyards

From the _**Main Square**_ you can access the Bucan Ville _**shipyards**_, where your players can also acquire a boat they can afford.

There they'll find _**Sam**_, a nautical geek with thick glasses and a t-shirt that says, «Kiss me, I'm a model ship builder».

_**Sam**_ lives to design and build ships… to scale (he always says this quietly), and since he hasn't been able to dedicate himself to building them, he sells them.

Despite being a main character and being able to talk about many topics, _**Sam**_ only talks about ships, ship design, the history of navigation, nautical trivia, etc. If you try to talk about something else, he steers the conversation back to ships.

If they tell him they want to buy a ship, he'll offer them what he has in stock: a luxury pirate ship, a second-hand pirate ship, and a fishing boat. When your players explain their financial situation—that is, zero doubloons—he'll take them to one side of the shipyard and show them an old _**rowboat**_ with a broken oar.

_**Sam**_ will casually mention that the _**luxury pirate ship**_ costs so many gold doubloons that they could only afford it by robbing the _**governor's safe**_, but it's truly luxurious. In fact, the wheel even has its own ebony coaster; the problem no one noticed is that when you turn it, it flips over and spills all the drinks.

After tough negotiations, _**Sam**_ will accept 200 gold doubloons to be paid with their first act of piracy and plunder. He will give them the _**title deed**_ to the _**rowboat**_ and a _**stack of papers specifying the payment method**_, which they must not lose.

\sp

To make it self-propelled, they will need something to serve as a mast and something to serve as a sail. There's a strike by sail and mast makers, and he's out of them, so your players will have to find something to replace it.

As we've already mentioned, for the sail they'll need the _**Twister vinylpad**_, and for the mast, the unbroken oar. With this, _**Sam**_ will set some candles and change the description of the _**title deed**_.

##### Souvenir Shop

Maxine the Red, the red-haired terror of the Caribbean, retired from piracy and used her earnings to open a souvenir shop selling famous pirate memorabilia in Bucan Ville. In her shop, you can find the most outlandish items from the pirate world, from a lock of Blackbeard's beard to Sir Francis Drake's mouthguard.

When someone tries to buy a clickable item, Maxine will spin some bizarre story to discourage them, such as it being infested with woodworm or belonging to a leper.

The only thing in the shop that could serve as a candle is a **Twister vinyl record** Pirate Edition with skulls, crossbones, treasure chests, and cannons instead of the colored circles.

Like most of the things in her shop, she doesn't want to part with the vinyl record because it reminds her of when she used to «play» (wink, wink, knock, knock) Twister with Anne Bonny, Jack Rackham, and Mary Read aboard the «Ranger».

The _**discount voucher**_ the _**Pirate Bosses**_ gave them has a typo, and if you take _**Lulock Holmes' magnifying glass**_ (Lulock Holmes is Sherlock Holmes' Caribbean cousin and the first pirate detective in literature) you can read the fine print. Where it should say «Presenting this voucher will get you a 50% discount on pirate merchandise OR a 50% discount on board games», it actually says «Presenting this voucher will get you a 50% discount on pirate merchandise AND a 50% discount on board games».

So, they can use the discount voucher to get the _**Twister vinyl**_ decal completely free, and Maxine can't refuse because, frankly, it's the cheapest and most useless thing she has in the shop.

Ideas for other silly things that might be in the shop and that you could put up as clickable items, but that Maxine doesn't want to sell because they bring back fond memories:

* Blackbeard's red curls
* Sir Francis Drake's dental splint
* Anne Bonny action figure with a karate punch, red-light eyes, and a button that makes her say, «If you had fought like a man, you wouldn't be hanged like a dog now».
* Long John Silver's running wooden leg
* Unofficial Pirates of the Caribbean merchandise signed by the main characters' stunt doubles

\sp

* A signed and dedicated photo of Ron Gilbert saying not to buy video games over $20.

#### 3. You are already a pirate

They can submit proof of their pirate status simultaneously or separately, but until they've fulfilled both requirements and proven it, they won't be considered full-fledged pirates, and the _**Pirate Bosses**_ will only call them cabin boys and/or landlubbers with mocking laughter.

After acquiring their ship and being on the wrong side of the law, the PCs can apply for their _**official Pirate Certificate**_, which identifies them as pirates, after paying the corresponding fee of one gold doubloon. You can use this as an opportunity to introduce new challenges, such as searching for loose change under the tavern's jukebox.

#### 4. Stealing the governor's safe

Throughout the previous scenes, your players will have heard about the governor, his safe, and the vast amounts of money he keeps inside. Since they can't attack comercial ships with their rowboat, they'll have to find a way to rob the governor so they can buy a real pirate ship.

When they leave the Boiled Crab Tavern, you can tell them that they can access the governor's house from the harbor. In fact, there's now a giant neon sign at the harbor that reads, «Visit Governor Marlon's Museum, where the magic of democracy happens».

##### Exterior of the governor's house

Governor Marlon's house is a Victorian home perched on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean Sea. It's luxurious and well-maintained; surely the upkeep and luxuries, like the _**equestrian statue of Governor Marlon**_, are paid for with the taxes of all the residents of Bucan Ville.

Examining his statue, Governor Marlon is a fine example of a human being: long hair, a chiseled chin with a divine dimple, broad shoulders, a torso sculpted in stone, and powerful arms and legs.

The exterior is guarded by _**peacocks**_ that squawk loudly as soon as they see you. Then a light from the second floor comes on, and Governor Marlon appears at the window to keep watch, armed with a black powder rifle. When he sees nothing suspicious, he goes back inside.

If you hide behind the _**equestrian statue**_ and hit them when they're not looking in your direction, you can take a _**feather**_ from them. When you have three feathers, you can make yourself a _**peacock feathers headdress**_ and the peacocks consider you one of their own and let you pass without notifying the governor.

##### Main hall of the governor's house

Upon entering the governor's house, you enter the main hall. It is large and luxurious, filled with works of art, expensive vases, ivory figures, and so on. The _**hall**_ is dimly lit by a few _**candles in a large chandelier**_.

\sp

If you try to pull or push the _**pulleys that raise and lower the chandelier**_, they will creak, and you will see lights from the upper floor and hear the sounds of Governor Marlon loading his rifle. This makes it impossible to lower the chandelier while it's making noise; you need some kind of lubricant.

Let them search the screens for something non-clickable that can serve as a lubricant, such as the grog the _**Pirate Bosses**_ drink, the turpentine the _**painter**_ in the _**Main Square**_ uses, etc., and make it clickable with their pixels.

##### Cellar hall of the governor's house

It's dark in the cellar, and all that's visible is the large _**safe door**_, covered in locks, combination dials, and gears. It looks incredibly complex—so complex, in fact, that Governor Marlon has hidden a note on a specific pixel of the screen with instructions on how to open it.

There's very little light in the cellar, and they'll only be able to find the exact pixel if they can get some light. The only light source will be the _**candles in the chandelier**_ in the _**main hall**_. If they try to bring in a light source from elsewhere (making something clickable), make it difficult for them, because they will be electric or gas-powered.

#### 5. The end?

When they finally manage to break into the governor's safe and are swimming in gold and jewels, they'll hear a loud cannon blast, and suddenly a cannonball will shatter one of the walls.

While they recover from the explosion, they'll see the fearsome vampire captain DraChuckla enter through the hole with his ghoul henchmen to seize their loot while laughing at them.

He'll approach the player characters, pluck a hair from each of them, and stick them to voodoo dolls, saying, «Just in case you become a problem», and then they'll fall unconscious.

When they manage to get up, they'll see through the hole in the wall that the black-sailed ship that was in the distance from the port is sailing away with DraChuckla on board and Governor Marlon tied and gagged.

### Diskettes #2 and #3

Here are some ideas for how you can continue this adventure, which could span disk 2 (the plot's climax) and disk 3 (the final resolution).

* You could try to rescue the governor from DraChuckla's clutches.
* You could try to find the Mac'n Cheese, the greatest pirate treasure ever known. DraChuckla is rumored to be after it, so you must be careful.
* You could try to learn voodoo magic to see if you can counteract what DraChuckla does with his dolls.
* Perhaps you could form a band and dedicate yourselves to playing reggae throughout the Caribbean.
