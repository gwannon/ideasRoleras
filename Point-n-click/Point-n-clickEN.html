<h2>The role-playing game of classic adventure game</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="columns">
<p>«Point and click RPG» is a small <strong>role-playing game for a GM and up to two players</strong> that tries to simulate the experience of classic point-and-click adventure games from the 80s and 90s, such as «Simon the Sorcerer» or «KingQuest».</p>
<p>These are video games where you control a character through a series of screens, solving various puzzles using objects on the screen and in your equipment, along with actions or verbs like <strong>Use, Pick Up, Open, Push, etc.</strong></p>
<p>You also interact with different characters who provide useful information and objects to help you solve more riddles.</p>
<p>As you progress and solve puzzles, stories of all kinds unfold, from fantastical voyages and pulp adventures to wacky cartoon-style situations.</p>
<p>In these stories, you can be a pathetic pirate, a cartoon character, an avid aviator, or even a time traveler lost in the past.</p>
<p>To play you will need <strong>paper, pencils and 6-sided dice (d6)</strong>. On the last pages you have colored pixels that you can print on cardboard and use as tokens.</p>

</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor3"></div>
<h2>Create your PC</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="columns">
<p>The first thing you need to do to start playing this role-playing game is to create a character for each player. The process is simple; you just need to make a few decisions and write them down on your character sheet.</p>
<h3>1. Step - Defining Your Adventure Game</h3>
<p>The first thing is to choose which Adventure Game (AG) your character comes from. The AG where your character was originated determines their abilities. Being a character from &quot;The Dig&quot; is not the same as being one from &quot;Maniac Mansion.&quot;</p>
<p>When defining which AG your character come from, the first step is to give your AG a title and <strong>choose the video resolution</strong> in which it was developed. Your resolution determines the initial pixels of your character. Your pixel count is important because it allows you to do special things within the GA.</p>
<p>It also determines the size of your equipment area. With low resolution, you have a lot of space because it's mostly text lists, while with high resolution, it's mostly complex pixelated images.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CGA:</strong> 320x200 and 4 colors, <strong>4 píxels</strong> and <strong>10 spaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>EGA:</strong> 320×200 and 16 colors, <strong>8 píxels</strong> and <strong>8 spaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>VGA:</strong> 640x480 and 256 colors, <strong>10 píxels</strong> and <strong>4 spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, choose your theme, <strong>choosing 2 topics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science Fiction:</strong> Adventures with futuristic or non-futuristic science fiction themes. <strong>+2 pixels</strong></li>
<li><strong>Franchise:</strong> Stories based on famous movies and book series. <strong>+2 spaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fantasy:</strong> Magical fairytale worlds inhabited by elves, dwarves, and other magical beings. <strong>+2 spaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>Horror:</strong> Scary and horrific stories featuring haunted houses, cursed towns, creatures frozen in ice, etc. <strong>+1 pixel and +1 space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Comedy:</strong> Wacky, cartoon-like stories, usually with eccentric characters or anthropomorphic animals. <strong>+2 pixels</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mystery:</strong> From Victorian detectives to modern police cases, including hard-boiled detectives. <strong>+2 pixels</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pulp:</strong> Pulp stories with heroes and heroines searching for lost civilizations, traveling by seaplanes, and almost always fighting Nazis. <strong>+1 pixel and +1 space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spicy:</strong> Stories that are very close to humor, but with spicy and lustful touches. <strong>+1 pixel and +1 space</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <strong>choose the developer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LucasArts Games:</strong> The developer of classic AG that everyone remembers. <strong>+2 pixels</strong></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor4"></div><div class='columns'>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sierra:</strong> The distinguished competition. <strong>+2 spaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alcachofa Soft:</strong> The geniuses of wacky humor. <strong>+1 pixel and +1 space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Revolution Software:</strong> A hidden gem that has produced some of the genre's greatest treasures. <strong>+2 pixels</strong></li>
<li><strong>Coktel studios:</strong> The geeks who were looking for alternative approaches to a very static format. <strong>+1 pixel and +1 space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pendulo Studios:</strong> They've tried to bring the genre back to its former glory without much success, but without losing hope and their touch. <strong>+2 spaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deconstructeam!:</strong> You're a modern indie gamer who enjoys retropixels. <strong>+2 pixels</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to <strong>calculate the equipment space and pixels</strong>. Remember that if the pixels or spaces are odd, convert one pixel to a space, or vice versa.</p>
<h3>2. Step - Create your interface</h3>
<p>Every character in an AG has some basic verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk to</li>
<li>Pick up</li>
<li>Give</li>
<li>Talk to</li>
<li>Look</li>
<li>Use</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you must <strong>choose 3 more verbs</strong> from this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open/Close</li>
</ul>
<p class="saltocolumna"></p>
<ul>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Turn on/Off</li>
<li>Hit</li>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Pull/Push</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Step - Finishing Touches</h3>
<p>As finishing touches, you must <strong>define your name</strong>, something that fits your AG and its theme, and <strong>choose your pronouns</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, you must <strong>choose a starting piece of equipment</strong> by rolling on the following table:</p>
<table>

<tr>

<th>Science Fiction, Fantasy, Pulp</th>
<th>Mystery, Horror, Franchise</th>
<th>Humor, Spicy</th>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="columns">
<h3>Scenes</h3>
<p><strong>Graphic adventures are divided into parts</strong>, and each part is <strong>divided into scenes and screens</strong>. A scene can consist of one or more screens and is usually associated with a main puzzle or challenge, which in turn contains other puzzles.</p>
<p>For example, a scene might involve finding the three missing pieces of a treasure map. One piece is lost in the library, another is in the dean's office, and the third is being sold by your office mate for $1,000. To solve the scene, you must recover each piece of the map by solving each puzzle or challenge (searching the library, sneaking into the dean's office, and getting $1,000) and then reassemble the map from the recovered pieces.</p>
<p>To solve the challenges in each scene, <strong>you must move between the different screens</strong> at the points where they connect. If you want to go to the dean's office, you'll need to enter through the university entrance, pass by her secretary's desk, and then enter her office. We'll have three interconnected screens, so you can't (for now) get from the entrance to the office without passing by the secretary.</p>
<p>There may be screens that are inherently challenging to enter, requiring you to solve a puzzle to gain access. For example, you might have to convince the dean's secretary that there's free frozen yogurt in the university cafeteria and, on top of that, find the office key hidden under the ficus planter.</p>
<p>Upon <strong>entering a new screen</strong>, the GM should <strong>describe all the clickable elements in the scene</strong>. Initially, the PCs can only interact with clickable elements, but as we'll see later, by spending pixels, they can interact with other, previously non-clickable elements.</p>
<p>The GM should also provide an <strong>indication of how this screen connects to others</strong> that don't have a direct logical link. If you're in a bell tower, the GM can mention that the screen is above the screen for the church entrance, and the harbor lighthouse is visible in the distance. This will suggest to the PCs that they might be able to interact with the lighthouse from here, for instance, using the binoculars they stole from the museum.</p>
<h3>Actions and Rolls</h3>
<p>There are different types of possible actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verb + Equipment</li>
<li>Verb + Equipment + Equipment</li>
<li>Verb + Clickable Element in the Scene</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor6"></div><div class='columns'>
<ul>
<li>Verb + Equipment + Clickable Element in the Scene</li>
<li>Insert + Clickable Element / Remove + Equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions can or cannot be performed; there is no possibility of success or failure. Therefore, normally there are no rolls.</p>
<p>Rolls only occur in the rare situations where an action can fail. In that case, you roll 1d6, and if you roll 4 or higher, you succeed. You can grant a +1 bonus if they have suitable equipment or if they discover something that gives them an advantage.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to spit in the spitting contest, we roll 1d6. If they say they spit when the wind blows or take a shoot of grog first to thicken their phlegm, you could give them a +1 bonus for each cheat applied.</p>
<p>When using items, equipment items are always within easy reach, but clickable items require you to approach them to use them. This means that if they're unreachable, like deer antlers above the door, you'll need a chair or a ladder first.</p>
<p>On the other hand, logic dictates whether equipment is consumed when used. A match is used up, but a matchbox has infinite uses.</p>
<h3>The Equipment</h3>
<p>In each slot, you can place one object that shouldn't be larger than something that would fit in your pockets or a backpack. Weight doesn't matter; as long as it fits in a backpack and there are free spaces, you can put it in.</p>
<p>If you have, for example, 6 equipment sspacess, you can put in your equipment a pumpkin, a watermelon, the head of a Roman emperor sculpture, needle and thread, a trumpet, and an Arkansas Panthers pin.</p>
<p>Each object occupies one equipment slot, and if you try to put a large barrel of wine in your equipment, it won't fit because you don't have any free space, and it won't fit in a backpack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can ignore this size rule in humorous cartoon-style games where the pockets are more spacious.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Using Your Pixels</h3>
<p>Pixels are what make your character feel real, allowing them to do extraordinary things, exploiting glitches and bugs in the Game Master, reading game guides, trying everything with everything, and so on.</p>
<p>The possible uses of pixels are:</p>
<h4>Making Background Elements Clickable</h4>
<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of Adventure Games was seeing things on the screen that you could use but couldn't click. By exploiting bugs and spending between 1 and 4 pixels, at the GM's discretion, you can make something unclickable clickable. It will only be clickable while you're on the screen; it will become unclickable as soon as you leave the screen.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor7"></div><div class='columns'>
<h4>Read the Guide</h4>
<p>If you spend pixels, you can read a game guide from your favorite video game magazine and receive a hint on how to solve a puzzle or fix a problem. It can also remind you of a detail you might have forgotten. Depending on the number of pixels you spend, from 1 to 4, you'll receive more or less information, and it will be more or less interesting and clear.</p>
<h4>Try Everything with Everything</h4>
<p>You can spend all your pixels (minimum 4) to try every item in your equipment with every clickable element in the scene (not the screen). In this case, you'll eventually find the next action you need to take but haven't been able to find. However, the challenge or scene might not be solved this way, and you may still need to perform other actions, but at least it will guide the players toward the right path.  </p>
<h4>Parallel Plot</h4>
<p>If a player spends all their points (minimum 4), they can request a parallel plot. A message will appear on screen saying &quot;Meanwhile in [location]…&quot; and the current villain will be seen speaking and revealing part of their plan or their next steps. It could also be some kind of important information, such as the ingredients of a chemical formula or the name of the magic grimoire containing the spell to destroy them.</p>
<p class="saltocolumna"></p>
<h4>Force the Theme</h4>
<p>By spending 1 pixel, players can force the theme of the adventure they are playing or the one they came from and gain a +1 bonus to a roll. For example, a character from a fantasy adventure can try to gain a +1 bonus to a roll if they have a sword duel, or in a science fiction adventure, a player can try to gain a +1 bonus to a Search roll by claiming that their tricorder's sensors are very advanced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are free to create new uses for pixels that suit your graphic adventure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Recovering Pixels</h4>
<p>You recover pixels in certain situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon completing a scene, you recover up to half of your maximum pixels.</li>
<li>At the GM's discretion, if they deem it fun and fitting for their character and the story. <strong>DON'T BE STINGY ABOUT GIVING AWAY PIXELS.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Adventure Game special rules</h3>
<p>Adventure Games sometimes have their own logic, and all the following rules attempt to reflect that.</p>
<h4>Object Permanence</h4>
<p>The <strong>equipment you leave</strong> in a screen <strong>remains in that screen</strong>; only your characters and other important characters can pick it up.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor8"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>If you build a rope bridge over a chasm, that bridge will stay there forever. But even if you want to cross it and want to retrieve your rope, you dismantle the bridge, thus recovering the rope and no longer being able to cross to the other side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's important to keep track of scenes and objects and how they are arranged.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Accessing the Map</h4>
<p>At some point, someone will give you a map, a passport, or something similar, allowing you to access the map and move directly to a scene without having to go through other screens.</p>
<p>From the map, you can move directly to the beginning of any screen you've already visited. Keep in mind that any objects used to reach a screen will no longer be needed and can be picked up.</p>
<p>Following the previous example of the rope bridge, you no longer need to have the bridge built to reach the screens on the other side of the chasm. You can go directly there using the map.</p>
<h4>Moving Objects</h4>
<p>Moving objects within a screen or between screens is easy; they're stored in your inventory. For larger objects, you can use Pull/Push to move them within the screen.</p>
<p>If you want to move heavy objects between screens, you'll need to use some kind of trick or contraption, from using fryer grease to push them downhill to a complicated pulley system or a minecart.</p>
<h4>Screen Width</h4>
<p>The group of characters cannot be separated; AGs don't have split screen, so everyone stays together. In fact, there will be things you can't access in a scene because another player is on the other side and your screen resolution isn't high enough to reach them.</p>
<h4>Screen Connections</h4>
<p>The screens in a scene have connections that your players can walk throught, and others that they can't, but which they can use to their advantage.</p>
<p>For example, if you climb onto a roof and knock down a tile, it can knock unconscious the guard at the door you wanted to enter. Your characters can't move from the roof to the door of the hideout, but the tile can.</p>
<h4>Single Pixel</h4>
<p>When things are hidden, they can be located in a single pixel on the screen. This means that to find it, you have to make a Search roll; a simple Look roll won't suffice.</p>
<h4>Maze</h4>
<p>There are labyrinthine areas like caves, sewers, or passageways that cause players to move in circles and eventually exit the way they came in.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor9"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>In these areas, you must meet a condition to find the exit and be able to cross them. This might involve having a compass, knowing the correct order to follow, or observing the path a rat takes.</p>
<p>The important thing is that, without this clue, it's impossible to cross that labyrinthine area.</p>
<h4>Copy Protection</h4>
<p>Copy protections were systems that prevented players from simply making a copy of the diskette where the game was stored.</p>
<p>They were dynamic questions that could only be answered with a physical device, such as a coordinate card whose numbers were only visible with a red filter and which couldn't be photocopied, or circular cards with holes that had to be moved to a precise position to extract a piece of information through the holes. The truth is, they weren't very effective systems and are now seen as quite naive.</p>
<p>Applying this to this role-playing game, copy protection allows the GM to make any request, and if the players want to play, they must comply. If they don't, the copy protection kicks in, and the session doesn't continue until the GM's request is met.</p>
<p>As the GM, you can request things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the GM can eat gummy bears, or there must always be popcorn in a bowl near the GM.</li>
</ul>
<p class="saltocolumna"></p>
<ul>
<li>No cell phones on the table.</li>
<li>If a die falls off the table, all players must stand up, turn around, shout &quot;Ahoy sailors,&quot; and toast the DJ.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Saving the Game</h4>
<p>It's not necessary to explain what &quot;saving the game&quot; is; it's something many video games still do today. But we will explain how it applies to this role-playing game.</p>
<p>This action can only be performed <strong>once per session</strong> and with <strong>all players agreeing</strong>, and it provides several benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>In case of death (as we'll see in AG creation), we will return to the save point, not to the beginning of the scene.</li>
<li>Since we usually only save when we think something important is about to happen or we might die, this action restores up to half of your character's maximum pixels. If your character has a maximum of 10 pixels and only 3 remain, they receive 2 more pixels. If they have 12 and only 8 remain, they don't receive any because they are already above half their maximum.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor10"></div>
<h2>Non-player character</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="columns">
<p>There is a special type of clickable element called non-player characters (NPCs). There are three types of NPCs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monophrase:</strong> They only have one line and appear in only one scene.</li>
<li><strong>Multiphrases:</strong> They have several lines with an important clue, can appear in different scenes, and can give or receive items.</li>
<li><strong>Main characters:</strong> Key characters with many lines, appear in many scenes, and constantly give clues and equipment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These types are not fixed; a monophrase character can become a multiphrase character later in the adventure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Monophrase</h3>
<p>These characters are the simplest in the Game Guides and only have one line they utter when you try to talk to them. They usually say silly things or jokes, and in a few cases, they offer a very cryptic clue. Some have a simple movement routine, like walking from one point to another or pushing a large stone block.</p>
<p>Recording the line they're going to say is enough. Aside from uttering their line, they're not much else to use.</p>
<p>Some of them, especially those with movement capabilities, can be used as clickable elements to solve a challenge or puzzle. For example, you could smear grease on a monophrase character so that seagulls attack it, causing it to drop its oil barrel and make another, more important NPC slip.</p>
<h4>Old lady with walker (monophrase)</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.pngaaa.com/detail/674344" title="Angry Old Lady by pngaaa.com"><img src="./images/674344-middle.png" alt="Angry Old Lady by pngaaa.com" title="Angry Old Lady by pngaaa.com" /></a></p>
<p>His only sentence is, &quot;Have you thought about adding more fiber to your diet?&quot; He moves slowly with his walker, and when you enter his screen, he's at a random point.</p>
<h4>Dog with a bone (monophrase)</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/pixel-dalmatian-dogs-toy-bones-image-vector-illustration-pixel-art-pixel-dalmatian-dogs-toy-bones-image-vector-image222013779" title="Pixel dalmatian dogs with toy bones image by Chibitheo"><img src="./images/perro-hueso.png" alt="Pixel dalmatian dogs with toy bones image by Chibitheo" title="Pixel dalmatian dogs with toy bones image by Chibitheo" /></a></p>
<p>It stands next to a blind beggar on the main street. His only utterance is &quot;Grrrrr&quot; when you approach the blind man's donations or try to take the bone from his feet. Perhaps you can distract him with a steak, a cat, or a ball.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor11"></div><div class='columns'>
<h3>Multiphrases</h3>
<p>Son personajes <strong>más complejos</strong> que los anteriores, con más frases, objetos que pueden dar o recibir y alguna rutina de movimiento. Seguramente tengan alguna tarea como dar información sobre cierto asunto, evitar que puedan acceder a cierta zona o que consigan ciertos objetos. </p>
<p>Más que frases deberás elegir un par de temas de los que saben mucho y de los que podrían hablar con las PJ y también la información clave que pueden darles.</p>
<p>En caso de que debamos conseguir algo de ellos (información, objetos o acceso), deberías apuntar como se puede conseguir, quizás sea dándole otro objeto, preguntándole algo exactamente, o haciendo alguna serie de acciones con objetos clicables cercanos y/o del equipo.</p>
<p>También deberías apuntarles algunas debilidades que las jugadoras puedan aprovechar y que seguramente ellos mismos u otros personajes les comenten a las jugadoras.</p>
<h4>Tipo sospechoso en un callejón (multiphrase)</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/53228943-shadowy-alley-show-the-detective-silhouetted-against-a-dimly-lit-alley-trench-coat-billowing-as-he-peers-around-a-corner-a-street-lamp-illuminating-the-scene" title="Shadowy Alley Show the detective silhouetted by Fedor Lunin"><img src="./images/figura-callejon.png" alt="Shadowy Alley Show the detective silhouetted by Fedor Lunin" title="Shadowy Alley Show the detective silhouetted by Fedor Lunin" /></a></p>
<p>Avanzas por la calle y de repente de un callejón sale un «¡Eh, tú, pringao!», preguntas «¿Yo?» y responde «¡Sí, tú, pringao!». Entras y hay un tipo sospechoso con sombrero calado que no te deja ver su cara y una gabardina larga que le cubre hasta los pies. </p>
<p class="saltocolumna"></p>
<p>¿Es un ladrón que te va a robar? ¿Es un traficante de drogas o, peor, de cartas Pokémon? ¿Un pervertido? No lo sabes y mejor no acercarse.</p>
<p>Si te acercas, es un vendedor de globos de helio de formas divertidas. Puedes hablar con él de varios temas, globos de helio, inversiones en criptomonedas y cartas Pokémon.</p>
<p>Si le consigues <strong>una buena carta Pokémon, te dará un montón de globos de helio</strong> que podrías usar para levantar algo pesado o volar unos metros. También puedes conseguir los globos con algo que parezca una criptomoneda como los tokens de la lavandería.</p>
<h3>Main characters</h3>
<p>Son tan complejo como tus propias jugadoras, tienen infinitas frases, su propio equipo y se mueven por toda las pantallas a su gusto y aparecerán en casi todas las escenas. Seguramente sean las némesis de tus jugadoras o personajes con mucho peso en la historia.  </p>
<p>Si son el villano, no suelen tener acciones que nos permitan conseguir algo, por ejemplo, empujarlos para que se les caiga una moneda, sino que encontrar la manera de derrotarlos es el desafío de una escena completa, incluso de una parte completa.</p>
<p>Es normal que empezarán como multiphrase y un cambio en la historia los convierta en main characters. Quizás el pilluelo de la calle que te da rumores del mundo criminal (multiphrase), sea secuestrado y se convierta en main character.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor12"></div><div class='columns'>
<h4>Vampirate captain (main character/villano)</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-design-pixel-art-character-element-collection_33111981.htm" title="Flat design pixel art character element collection by freepik"><img src="./images/7965103.png" alt="Flat design pixel art character element collection by freepik" title="Flat design pixel art character element collection by freepik" /></a></p>
<p>Estas ante el terror del todo Caribe, pronunciar su nombre llena de miedo el corazón. Es el villano perfecto para tu aventura. Además de capitán pirata y vampiro, es un usuario de poderosa magia vudú y posee un barco zombi con su tripulación de sirvientes ghouls. </p>
<p>Sus debilidades son las típicas de los piratas y de los vampiros, es decir, por un lado, el grog, el oro y los mancebos y/o mancebas y, por otro lado, el sol, las cruces, el agua bendita, el ajo y los mancebos y/o mancebas. Así que tus jugadoras deberán buscar la manera de usar esas debilidades contra él. Quizás algún otro usuario del vudú pueda ayudarles.</p>
<p>Además, con suerte, quizás tus jugadoras logren averiguar si es pirata al que convirtieron en vampiro o un vampiro que se decidió dedicarse a la piratería. </p>
<h3>Interactuar con los PNJ</h3>
<p>Al interactuar con PNJ ahí serie de reglas que puedes seguir y que le darán a la partida el sabor a AG:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puedes preguntar las veces que sean que o se van a molestar y siempre deberían dar la misma respuesta. Las respuestas solo cambiarán si haces algo distintos. Tampoco deberían molestarse.</li>
</ul>
<p class="saltocolumna"></p>
<ul>
<li>Lo mismo pasa cuando usas objetos con ellos, mientras no uses el adecuado no debería cambiar nada. Si les das dinero, simplemente lo rechazará, si le tiras un cubo de agua, se apartará o simplemente se mojará y te gritará, pero no se moverá de la puerta que guarda. Pero si sacas un ratón y le das un trozo de queso al portero, el ratón se acercará atraído por el olor a queso y el PNJ saldrá corriendo atemorizado por el roedor.</li>
<li>Normalmente, el truco de un PNJ deja de funcionar cuando se cambia de pantalla o de escena. Si el portero vuelve aparecer en otra escena, ya no funcionará lo del ratón y te dirá que su psicoanalista le ha ayudado en ese tema.</li>
<li>Los PNJ solo participan en un reto por escena, nuestro portero es un reto para entrar en la guarida de la mafia. Una vez superado este reto, no va a dar equipo o pistas para otros retos, pero no siempre.</li>

<h2>Crear una aventura gráfica</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="columns">
<h3>Duración de una aventura</h3>
<p>Para empezar a crear la aventura gráfica debes decidir su duración. La duración de una AG mide en disquetes y cada disquete es una sesión de juegos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Termina tus sesiones diciendo algo gracioso como «Introduce disquete número 2».</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>1 disquete 5¼</h4>
<p>Las aventuras en disquetes de 5¼, debido a la poca capacidad de los ordenadores, eran aventuras cortas con una escena por cada una de las partes y dos pantallas máximo cada escena. Perfectas para una tarde delante de tu pantalla.</p>
<h4>1 disquete de 3½</h4>
<p>Los ordenadores tienen ya más potencia y permiten alargar las tramas. Son aventuras ya más complejas que pueden suponer varias sesiones delante de la pantalla. Cada parte puede tener dos o más escenas y múltiples pantallas por cada una de esas escenas.</p>
<h4>Varios disquetes de 3½</h4>
<p>Estamos hablando ya de muchas horas de juego y que normalmente pueden involucrar varias aventuras gráficas seguidas con la misma temática y personajes/villanos recurrentes. Hablamos de sagas como los «KingQuest» o los «Monkey Island».</p>
<h3>Primeros toques</h3>
<p>Una vez decidida la duración hay que hacer como cuando creas un personaje y elegir su resolución, 2 temáticas y escoger su desarrolladora. Resolución:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CGA:</strong> La baja resolución y la falta de colores de estas AG hace que sea difícil interactuar con los elementos en pantalla. Todas las posibles tiradas tiene un penalizador de -1. Por suerte, las jugadoras pueden poner píxeles (a discreción del DJ) para transformar un objeto o elemento clicable en otro siempre que sean muy parecidos. Por ejemplo, podrían transformar una vela en un cartucho de dinamita encendido. Además, al tener tan pocos colores, olvídate de hacer puzzles con colores.</li>
<li><strong>EGA:</strong> Las aventuras en EGA tienen una cantidad de colores y resolución aceptable y normal y no añaden ni quitan nada a las AG.</li>
<li><strong>VGA:</strong> La mayor resolución del VGA hace que se tengan que gastar más píxeles extras de lo normal, porque todo tienes más píxeles, así que todos los gastos de píxeles cuestan un píxel extra. La resolución también hace que las tiradas de Buscar los píxeles exactos tengan un penalizador extra de -1.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor14"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>Elige dos temáticas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ciencia ficción:</strong> La ciencia ficción es muy amplia y permite una amplia variedad de temas, desde aventuras en planetas alienígenas a viajes en el tiempo o clonación. Al montar la AG deberás establecer un nivel tecnológico y que tecnologías hay y cuáles no. Igual hay clones y poderes psíquicos, pero no hay viajes espaciales, ni robots. </li>
<li><strong>De franquicia:</strong> La aventura tendrá que tener al héroe o la heroína insignia de la franquicia, así que una de tus jugadoras no podrá hacerse el personaje, deberá ser ese personaje icónico y se lo darás hecho. </li>
<li><strong>Fantasía:</strong> La fantasía y sobre todo la fantasía medieval es un tema recurrente, siempre más cercana a cuentos clásicos con trolls debajo de puentes y princesas y príncipes que a la fantasía d&amp;d/tolkien más propia de otros juegos de rol. La otra opción son mundos mágicos totalmente diferentes como en el clásico «Loom». En estas AG los verbos de tus personajes puedes considéralos hechizos y no necesitan estar al lado del elemento cliclabe, solamente en la misma pantalla.</li>
<li><strong>Horror:</strong> Estas aventuras deberían ser altamente mortales y puede ser muy interesante montar algún tipo de contador o reloj que meta presión a las jugadoras. Tienen tantos intentos para terminar una escena y si no lo consiguen el monstruo acabará con sus vidas.</li>
<li><strong>Humor:</strong> Las aventuras de humor no pueden ser mortales, no va con el tono. Igual morir y convertirse en fantasma puede ser una escena divertida.</li>
<li><strong>Misterio:</strong> Quizás una historia de Sherlock Holmes no deba ser mortal, pero algo más oscuro si debiera serlo.</li>
<li><strong>Pulp:</strong> Como se suele decir, todo es mejor con un toque pulp, desde la ciencia ficción a las historias picantes. Si coges «Pulp» y «De franquicia» como serían Conan, el Zorro o Indiana Jones, puedes coger un tercer tema que defina la aventura mejor. </li>
<li><strong>Picantes:</strong> Las venturas picantes siempre quedan bien con humor, no olvidemos los «Leisure Suit Larry», pero también pueden funcionar con lo «pulp». Recuerda hablar sobre esta opción con tu mesa. </li>
</ul>
<p>Elige la empresa desarrolladora:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LucasArts Games:</strong> El humor es la insignia de LucasArts, por lo que es conocido, pero en realidad han tocado todos los géneros. Aunque no hagas aventuras de humor, debes meterle algún chiste, alguna frase graciosa y algún personaje paródico. Importante, en estas aventuras <strong>la muerte no existe</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Sierra:</strong> La distinguida competencia estaba claro que no iba a explotar la marca de la casa de LucasArts, así que <strong>el humor está vetado</strong> en esta desarrolladora. Es importante que la aventura se llamen «LoQueSeaQuest», piensa en los «KingQuest», «SpaceQuest» o «PoliceQuest». Las aventuras de Sierra <strong>siempre son mortales</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor15"></div><div class='columns'>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alcachofa Soft:</strong> El humor es lo tuyo, así que mínimo <strong>uno de los temas debe ser humor</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Revolution Software:</strong> Sus creadores querían crear un punto medio entre los juegos de LucasArts y Sierra con juegos que no se tomaran demasiado en serio, pero con historias serias. Los «Broken Sword» fueron su gran éxito y esto hace que el <strong>Misterio sea algo muy típico</strong> en sus trabajos.</li>
<li><strong>Coktel Studios:</strong> Esta desarrolladora francesa fue subsidiaria de Sierra, pero en vez de ser absorbida siempre mantuvo tu toque diferente con sagas como Goblins. Intentaron montones de variaciones de «Point and click» con más o menos fortuna. Trata de que haya en sus AG alguna mecánica diferente y rompedora, que cambie la interfaz, el uso de píxeles, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Pendulo Studios:</strong> Tus pantallas son pequeños minipuzzles hilados en una historia. Es por ello que debería haber más proporción de puzzles que de conversaciones o interacciones con elementos de la pantalla. <strong>Solo desarrollas en VGA</strong> y los personajes también deberían serlo, pero no es obligatorio.</li>
<li><strong>Deconstructeam!:</strong> Eres una desarrolladora moderna, eso del CGA y EGA no es lo tuyo. Como Pendulo <strong>solo desarrollas en VGA</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Con estos datos deberías crear la sinopsis del juego que estaría escrita en la cara trasera de la caja de la AG. Este par de párrafos será la introducción con la que deberías empezar la partida.</p>
<p>Una vez elegido todo lo anterior, debes decidir <strong>si la aventura será mortal o no</strong>. Esa es una de las grandes diferencias entre unas AG y otras.</p>
<h4>Aventuras mortales</h4>
<p>Estas aventuras tendrán ciertas situaciones definidas como mortales. Desde enfrentarse a espadazos con un caballero medieval a cruzar una sala llena de láseres asesinos.</p>
<p>Si las jugadoras intentan llevar a cabo esas acciones, deberían poder tirar para superar esas acciones. Si fallan, simplemente morirán. Aquí no hay puntos de vida o heridas.</p>
<p>Deberías avisar de que lo que quieren hacer es muy peligroso antes de tirar los dados.</p>
<p>También deberías haber dispuesto elementos y acciones previas que les den bonos a las tiradas, como meter una llave inglesa en sus guantes de boxeo o atravesar un pasillo cuando los ojos rojos de la calavera pardean porque se está reactivando el mecanismo que lanza dardos envenenados de las paredes.</p>
<h4>Aventuras no mortales</h4>
<p>En estas aventuras simplemente no podrán intentar la acción peligrosa que quieren hacer y significará muchas veces que les falta algo para solucionar el reto.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor16"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>Imaginemos que hay un río de lava y han puesto una cuerda sobre el río de lava. Si intentan cruzar el río haciendo equilibrios sobre la cuerda, el personaje se girará, mirará a la pantalla y le dura algo gracioso como «¿Estás tonto?» o «Mi madre no crío a un tonto».</p>
<p>Seguramente faltará algo y tengan que volver a coger una fregona, quitarle el mocho y usarla de pértiga para cruzar el río como un equilibrista. Y no te extrañes que más adelante uses el mocho como peluca para disfrazarte.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Las aventuras de humor no deberían ser mortales, pero tu partida, tus reglas.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Has muerto …</h4>
<p>Cuando un <strong>personaje muere</strong>, simplemente <strong>desaparece</strong>, explota, cae por un pozo sin fondo, es desintegrado, etc. y <strong>aparece de nuevo cuando se termine de solucionar la escena</strong> con todo su equipo, pero sin píxeles. </p>
<p>Si todas las jugadoras mueren, entonces es más grave y ambos aparecerán al principio de la escena y deberán hacerla de nuevo. Habrán perdido todo el avance que hubieran hecho en esa escena y encima están todos sin píxeles.</p>
<h3>Estructura principal</h3>
<p>Las AG se suelen dividir como todas las historias en 3 partes, presentación, nudo y desenlace, y cada una de ellas en varias escenas con sus retos y puzzles a solucionar.</p>
<p>Las escenas de cada parte pueden ser secuenciales o transcurrir paralelamente, incluso un mix de ambas.</p>
<p>Por ejemplo, secuencial sería si debes conseguir el mapa que te dice donde está la tumba perdida del rey, sortear las trampas de la tumba y terminar descifrando los símbolos del medallón del rey para poder abrir el portal que te permita avanzar a la segunda parte.</p>
<p>Paralelamente, sería que tengas que investigar a la vez tres pistas encontradas en el lugar del asesinato para dar con el asesino.</p>
<h3>Escenas y pantallas</h3>
<p>Cada escena va a tener uno o varios retos y van a tener una o más pantallas. Para crear una escena es tan sencillo como definir qué va a pasar en esa escena y escribir un par de párrafos en que debería pasar en esa escena. A partir de ahí tenemos que definir los elementos de esa escena que va a tener, pantallas, PNJ y elementos clicables y como se relacionan.</p>
<p>La forma más sencilla de registrar todo esto es hacerte un esquema de las pantallas con sus elementos clicables y los PNJ que hay en ellos. También debes apuntas como se conectan las pantallas y que conexiones se pueden usar y que conexiones están cerradas y necesitan ser abiertos. </p>
<p>La aventura «El enigma de la Península del Simio» te muestra como puedes esquematizarlo.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor17"></div><div class='columns'>
<h4>Retos, acertijos y minipuzzles</h4>
<p>Por retos entendemos una combinación de acciones, elementos clicables y PNJ para solucionar un problema. Debemos definir que vamos a necesitar y como conseguirlo, quizás simplemente sea hablar con alguien en concreto como el tercer pasajero del autobús. También pueden ser opciones más complejas: coger el sobre de ketchup de la mesa, dárselo al comensal 1 que te lo agradecerá dándote su puré de patatas y embozar el baño con el puré para que el cocinero del restaurante tenga que salir de la cocina para arreglarlo y poder así entrar en la cocina.</p>
<p>Cuando examinen los elementos clicables deberán tener pistas de como pueden usar esos objetos, por ejemplo con frases como «Este puré es tan espeso que serviría de cemento». Al hablar con los PNJ deberían obtener también pista, como «No voy a volver a este restaurante, la comida es insípida y este el peor puré de patatas que he comido nunca». Quizás poner un desatascador cerca del cocinero sea otra pista y al examinarlo decir que está muy usado y tiene muchas manchas de grasa de hamburguesas.</p>
<p>Para hacer acertijos o minipuzzles puedes inspirarte en cualquier cosa, solamente debes adaptarlo a la ambientación de la AG. Si quieres meter un rompecabezas de piezas deslizante tendrá una imagen azteca, si es un rollo pulp años 20 o de circuitos si es una historia ciberpunk.</p>
<p>De los acertijos, tienes muchos en internet y como los puzzles con solo adaptarlo a la ambientación ya lo tienes hecho. </p>
<h3>Paso del tiempo</h3>
<p>El tiempo no pasa en las AG. Si una escena trascurre de noche, hagan lo que hagan durante la escena será siempre de noche, aunque esperen horas en un mismo sitio, seguirá siendo de noche. </p>
<p>El tiempo solo avanza (si se quiere) al final de cada escena. Tienes toda una noche para descubrir quién mató al comisario y cuando lo descubres se hace día y te lanzas a una loca carrera por capturar a su asesino que intenta huir a México.</p>
<p>Igual que las jugadoras pueden forzar con píxeles un «mientras tanto», <strong>el DJ puede forzar flashbacks</strong> para dar información a las jugadoras, incluso alguna escena puede ser un flashback en el que jueguen con su yo del pasado.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No es hacer «metajuego» usar información a través del tiempo. Lo que sabes de la aventura puedes usarlo cuando quieras por muchos cambios temporales que haya.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Aventuras sobre raíles</h3>
<p>Las AG son ejemplos clásicos de aventuras sobre raíles, solo hay un camino y una manera de avanzar y cualquier otra forma de actuación no funciona.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor18"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>Sin embargo, esto no es divertido en un juego de rol. Pero a diferencia de un videojuego como DJ puede solucionar esto, sus decisiones no están fijadas en el código, sino que pueden modificar la historia y aceptar otras opciones.</p>
<p>Así que, si las jugadoras proponen una opción viable que solucione los retos, déjales que funcione a pesar de que no sea la solución que haya pensado. </p>
<h3>Toques finales</h3>
<p>Por último, si no lo has hecho ya, márcate una mecánica chula que diferencie tu aventura del resto. Veamos algunos ejemplos clásicos:</p>
<ul>
<li>En «Loom» no son verbos, son combinaciones de notas musicales y si las hace sonar al revés hacen lo contrario. Si Do Re Mi abre cosas, Mi Re Do las cierra.</li>
<li>Los «Monkey Island» tienen sus duelos de insultos donde debes aprender afilados insultos y sus respuestas para vencer a tus enemigos en los duelos de espada.</li>
<li>«The Dig» tenía sus puzzles de barras de colores con diferentes poliedros. Debías encontrar la combinación adecuada entre diferentes pistas que veías en la aventura.</li>
</ul>

<h2>El enigma de la Península del Simio</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="columns">
<p><i>En lo profundo del Caribe hay una península rodeada de agua por todas partes llamada la Península del Simio. Adéntrate en sus oscuras grutas, sus espesas selvas y sus surtidas tiendas de regalos y souvenirs, para convertirte en una bucanera de pleno derecho.</i></p>
<p><i>Tendrás que enfrentarte a buques zombis, capitanes piratas vampiros o vampiratas, cabezas reducidas parlantes y muchos simios, usando tu inteligencia, tu ingenio y la poderosa y a veces explosiva magia vudú.</i></p>
<p><i>Si eres afortunada y evitas el escorbuto, quizás salgas viva de esta aventura y encuentres el tesoro pirata más grande conocido, el Mac’n Cheese, y te ganes el respeto de todo el Caribe.</i></p>
<p>«El enigma de la Península del Simio» es una aventura gráfica en EGA de 3 disquetes de 3½. Su temática es Humor y Fantasía y su desarrolladora es LucasArts Games. Este capítulo solo comprende el primer disquete de los tres que sería la campaña completa.</p>
<h3>Disquete I: Cómo ser un pirata</h3>
<p>Tus PJ acaban de llegar a Bucan Ville, un nido de piratas, con la intención de hacerse piratas y ganar grandes cantidades de dinero con la piratería.</p>
<p>Esta parte se divide en 4 escenas, la primera será una breve presentación. Luego habrá dos escenas paralelas que consisten en que las Jefas Piratas les den el título de piratas tras pasar una prueba y otra en conseguir un barco y su bandera. La cuarta escena será el robo de la caja fuerte del gobernador.</p>
<h4>1. Inicio</h4>
<p>Las PJ aparecen al anochecer en el puerto de Bucan Ville y gritarán «Me llamo [nombre de PJ] y quiero ser una pirata».</p>
<h5>Puerto</h5>
<p>En este cochambroso y sucio puerto solo hay un sitio al que ir, la <i><strong>Taberna del Cangrejo Cocido</strong></i>, un antro de piratas donde el grog está aguado y los ganchitos y cacahuetes fueron grumetes de Barbanegra.</p>
<p>A lo lejos se ve un <i><strong>navío de velas negras</strong></i> rasgadas. Un brillo espectral inunda su cubierta y bandadas de murciélagos lo sobrevuelan.</p>
<p>Desde el puerto puedes acceder al <i><strong>Centro de Bucan Ville</strong></i>.</p>
<h5>La Taberna del Cangrejo Cocido</h5>
<p>El local es un cuchitril viejo y sucio y está abarrotado de <i><strong>piratas borrachos</strong></i>. Los pocos que no están durmiendo la mona, apenas pueden decir alguna frase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Así que quieres ser un pirata, ¿no? Habla con las 3 <i><strong>Jefas Piratas</strong></i>.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor20"></div><div class='columns'>
<ul>
<li>El grog de mis tiempos sí que era grog, no como el de ahora que le ponen sombrillitas, clavo y hojitas de menta. Nosotros le poníamos clavos de verdad.</li>
<li>¿Has oído hablar de <a href="https://arrrcthulhu.com/">¡Arrr! Cthulhu</a>, una excelente ambientación para vivir aventuras de piratas en un Caribe de los mitos de Cthulhu?</li>
<li>Me robaron la idea del simio-semáforo. Yo podría haber sido millonario y haberme retirado a una Isla del Caribe y pasarme el día bebiendo grog. Upsss, si eso ya lo hago.</li>
</ul>
<p>En una gran mesa al fondo están las <i><strong>3 Jefas Piratas</strong></i>. Las más poderosas piratas de Bucan Ville elegidas por el democrático método de pasar a cuchillo a todos su competencia.</p>
<p>Estas tres rudas piratas están en la mesa trasegando grog y cantando canciones salidas de tono. Cuando tus jugadoras les expliquen que quieren ser piratas se reirán un montón y les dirán que dejen de hacerlas perder el tiempo y seguirán a lo suyo. Tus jugadoras deberán demostrar que de verdad quieren ser piratas respondiendo a preguntas como estas.</p>
<ul>
<li>¿Cuál era la bandera de Barbanegra? - Un esqueleto con cuernos que sostiene un reloj de arena en la mano derecha y una lanza en la izquierda, utilizando la lanza para pinchar un corazón rojo que gotea tres gotas rojas de sangre.</li>
<li>¿Cuál se llamaba el primer barco de Barbanegra? - La venganza de la Reina Ana.</li>
<li>¿Cuál era el apodo de Stede Bonnet? - Caballero Pirata</li>
</ul>
<p>Les harán también cantar «Ron, ron, ron, la botella de ron» (cosa que deberán cantar tus jugadoras). Tras un rato tratando de demostrar de que son merecedores de una prueba, accederán a hacerle es examen estandarizado del gremio de piratas que consiste en dos pruebas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debes demostrar que estás al otro lado de la ley.</li>
<li>Tener tu propia nave acuática autopropulsada y crear su bandera pirata única y personalizada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tras explicar las pruebas estandarizadas, les harán firmar una serie de papeleo y les entregarán un <i><strong>bono de descuento</strong></i> de la <i><strong>Tienda de souvenir</strong></i>. Si piden alguna pista, solo les dirán que pregunten por <i><strong>Sam</strong></i> en el astillero para ver que pueden ofrecerles en tema de barcos.</p>
<p>En la mesa de las <i><strong>3 Jefas Piratas</strong></i> hay un <i><strong>frutero</strong></i> con naranjas, plátanos, manzanas, caramelos suizos con vitamina C y limones que según ellas son de su campaña contra el escorbuto. Si se lo piden podrán coger una <i><strong>pieza de fruta</strong></i>. Elige al azar entre una de ellas y dásela. Si se comen podrán, pedir otra. Mientras no se la coman, las <i><strong>Jefas Pirata</strong></i> les dirán que se terminen primero la otra fruta que cogieron.</p>
<h4>2.a Pasarse al otro lado de la ley</h4>
<p>Como han explicado las Jefas Piratas, para convertirse en pirata necesitan estar al otro lado de la ley de tener una prueba de ellos. </p>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor21"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>Hay varias opciones para cometer delitos:</p>
<ul>
<li>La forma más sencilla es cruzar en rojo el semáforo mono de la <i><strong>Plaza Mayor de Bucan Ville</strong></i>.</li>
<li>Otra forma es ponerse a la izquierda del <i><strong>juzgado</strong></i> y pedirle al <i><strong>pintor de cuadros</strong></i> que está en la <i><strong>Plaza Mayor</strong></i>.</li>
<li>Si intentan otros tipos de delitos, sus personajes mirarán a la pantalla y dirán cosas como «Mi madre no crio a un ladronzuelo» o «Esto me metería en problemas con Santa Claus».</li>
</ul>
<p>Si les ves muy perdidos en esta parte, recálcales lo del «otro lado de la ley» o recuérdales lo de pirata borracho en la Taberna del Cangrejo Cocido que decía que había inventado el simio-semáforo y que les dé una pista.</p>
<h5>Centro de Bucan Ville</h5>
<p>Las calles del centro están desiertas por la noche, las farolas de gas están encendidas y las tiendas están cerradas, todas menos la <i><strong>tienda de souvenirs</strong></i> con su gran cartel de neón que pone abierto 24 horas.</p>
<p>Para cruzar la calle que atraviesa el centro hay que atravesar un paso de cebra dirigido por un <i><strong>simio-semáforo</strong></i> y vigilado por un <i><strong>guardia de la ciudad</strong></i> que solo dice «¡Circulen, circulen!». El simio-semáforo es un semáforo manejado por un mono que cambia el color del semáforo moviendo unas palancas. Cuando te acercas, el simio mueve las palancas y siempre cruzas en verde.</p>
<p>Por mucho que lo intentes, el mono siempre lo pone en verde. La única manera de cruzar en rojo es darle un plátano al mono cuando esté en rojo y como se pone a comer el plátano se queda en rojo. En ese momento puedes cruzar y el <i><strong>guardia de la ciudad</strong></i> te pondrá una <i><strong>multa</strong></i> y, por tanto, serás una fuera de la ley.</p>
<h5>Plaza Mayor de Bucan Ville</h5>
<p>La Plaza Mayor es como todas las plazas, un gran espacio vacío de adoquines con un único <i><strong>árbol seco</strong></i> en el centro con un cartel que pone «Árbol para colgar piratas - Cerrado por reformas».</p>
<p>En el centro de la plaza hay un <i><strong>pintor de cuadros</strong></i> que está pintando el ayuntamiento. Pinta los cuadros a una velocidad superrápida y los deja en un <i><strong>montón</strong></i> que está a su lado. Si los examinan, verán que no son muy buenos.</p>
<p>Si tratan de hablar con él, les dirá que está muy ocupado, tiene que hacer 1000 cuadros iguales del ayuntamiento para la campaña de recaudación para la reelección del gobernador.</p>
<p>Al lado del ayuntamiento está el <i><strong>juzgado</strong></i>. Al acercarse verán que abre de 24:00 a 00:00 menos los fines de semana que cierra por descanso. Si se colocan a su izquierda antes de que el pintor empiece un nuevo cuadro y esperan a qué terminen, podrán coger una pintura donde están ellos junto a los juzgados, es decir, al otro lado de la ley, como pedían las <i><strong>Jefas Piratas</strong></i>.</p>
<p>Al otro lado del ayuntamiento podrán acceder a un <i><strong>callejón oscuro</strong></i> del que salen retazos aleatorios de una conversación.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor22"></div><div class='columns'>
<h5>Callejón oscuro</h5>
<p>Es solo una ubicación de trampa. Cuando entren, las voces se callarán y unas figuras desaparecerán en las sombras. En cuanto salgan a la plaza, volverán las voces.</p>
<h4>2.b Conseguir un barco y una bandera pirata</h4>
<p>El único sitio de la isla donde venden barcos es en el <i><strong>Astillero</strong></i> y lo único que se pueden pagar ahora mismo tus jugadoras es un barco de remos. El problema es que no está autopropulsado, con lo que deberán encontrar la forma de construirle una vela. </p>
<p>Para la tela de la vela solo tienen que conseguir el <i><strong>vinilo del Twister</strong></i> en la <i><strong>Tienda de souvenirs</strong></i>. El mástil simplemente será unos de los remos y deberán decir su idea a <i><strong>Sam</strong></i>, el gerente del <i><strong>astillero</strong></i>. </p>
<p>Puede que gasten píxeles en convertir elementos no clicables en clicables, como alfombras, sabanas, etc. Cuando se lo lleven a <i><strong>Sam</strong></i> este les pondrá alguna excusa tonta.</p>
<p>Si presentan la barca de remos a las <i><strong>Jefas piratas</strong></i> sin vela les suspenderán la prueba gritando al unísono «¡No es autopropulsado!»</p>
<p>La bandera no es un reto, déjales usar lo que encuentren para hacerse su bandera y si puedes conseguir que sea lo más ridícula posible. Pueden usar el <i><strong>bono descuento</strong></i> en la Tienda de Souvenirs y que el dependiente les dé cualquier chorrada que se te ocurra para que la usen para crear su bandera.  </p>
<h5>Astilleros</h5>
<p>Desde la Plaza Mayor se puede acceder a los astilleros de Bucan Ville, donde, igual, tus jugadoras pueden conseguir una embarcación que puedan pagar.</p>
<p>Allí encontrarán a Sam, un friki de la náutica con gafas de culo de vaso y una camiseta que pone «Bésame, soy constructor de maquetas de barcos».</p>
<p>Sam vive para diseñar y construir barcos ... a escala (siempre lo dice en bajito) y como no ha podido dedicarse a construirlos, se dedica a venderlos.</p>
<p>A pesar de ser un personaje principal y poder hablar sobre muchos temas, Sam solo habla de barcos, diseño de barcos, historia de la navegación, curiosidades de la náutica, etc. Si se intenta hablar de otra cosa, encauza la conversación de nuevo a los barcos.</p>
<p>Si le dicen que quieren comprar un barco, les ofrecerá lo que tiene en stock: Un barco pirata de lujo, un barco pirata de 2ª mano y un barco de pesca. Cuando tus jugadoras le expliquen su situación económica, es decir, 0 doblones, les llevará a un lado del astillero y les enseñará un viejo <i><strong>bote de remos</strong></i> con un remo partido.</p>
<p>Sam las dejará caer que el <i><strong>barco pirata de lujo</strong></i> cuesta tantos doblones de oro que solo robando la <i><strong>caja fuerte</strong></i> del <i><strong>gobernador</strong></i> podrían pagarlo, pero es que es puro lujo. De hecho, el timón tiene hasta su propio posavasos de ébano, el problema que nadie vio es que al girarlo se da la vuelta y derrama toda la bebida.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor23"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>Tras duras negociaciones, <i><strong>Sam</strong></i> aceptará 200 doblones de oro a pagar con su primer acto de piratería y saqueo. Les dará el título de propiedad del <i><strong>bote a remo</strong></i> y un <i><strong>montón de papeles especificando la forma de pago</strong></i> que no deben perder.</p>
<p>Para conseguir que sea autopropulsado necesitarán algo que sirva de mástil y algo que sirva de vela. Justo hay huelga de fabricantes de velas y mástiles y no le quedan, así que tus jugadoras deberán conseguir algo para reemplazarlo.</p>
<p>Como ya hemos dicho, para la vela necesitarán el <i><strong>vinilo del Twister</strong></i> y para el mástil el remo que no está roto. </p>
<h5>Tienda de souvenirs</h5>
<p>Maxine la roja, el terror pelirrojo del Caribe, se retiró de la piratería y con las ganancias monto una tienda de souvenirs de piratas famosos en Bucan Ville. En su tienda puedes encontrar las cosas más estrambóticas del mundillo pirata, desde un rizo de la barba de Barbanegra hasta la férula de descarga dental de Sir Francis Drake.</p>
<p>Cuando quieran llevarse algún elemento clicable, Maxine soltará alguna historia rara para que no se lo lleven, como que tiene carcoma o pertenecía a un leproso.</p>
<p>Lo único que hay en la tienda que pueda servir de vela es un <i><strong>vinilo del Twister</strong></i> Edición pirata con calaveras, tibias cruzadas, cofres del tesoro y cañones en vez de los círculos de colores.</p>
<p>Como la mayoría de las cosas de su tienda, no quiere deshacerse del vinilo porque le recuerda a cuando «jugaba» (guiño, guiño, golpe, golpe) al Twister con Anne Bonny, Jack Rackham y Mary Read a bordo del «Ranger».</p>
<p>El <i><strong>vale de descuento</strong></i> que les dieron las <i><strong>Jefas Piratas</strong></i> tiene una errata y si cogen la <i><strong>lupa</strong></i> de Lulock Holmes, el primo de las Antillas de Sherlock Holmes y el primer pirata detective de la literatura, podrán leer la letra pequeña. Donde debía poner «Al presentar este vale se conseguirá un 50% de descuento en material pirata O un 50% en juegos de mesa» en realidad pone «Al presentar este vale se conseguirá un 50% de descuento en material pirata Y un 50% en juegos de mesa».</p>
<p>Así que pueden usar el vale de descuento para conseguir el <i><strong>vinilo del Twister</strong></i> completamente gratis y Maxine no puede se negará porque la verdad es que lo más inútil y barato que tiene en la tienda.</p>
<p>Ideas para otras chorradas que puede haber en la tienda y que puedes poner como elementos clicables, pero que Maxine no quiere vender porque le traen buenos recuerdos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rizos pelirrojos de la barba la Barbanegra</li>
<li>Férula de descarga dental de Sir Francis Drake</li>
<li>Muñeco de acción de Anne Bonny con golpe de karate, ojos con luces rojas y un botón que hace que diga «Si hubieses luchado como un hombre, no serías ahora ahorcado como un perro» </li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor24"></div><div class='columns'>
<ul>
<li>Pata de palo de «running» de Long John Silver</li>
<li>Merchandising no-oficial de Piratas del Caribe firmado por los dobles de acción de los protagonistas</li>
<li>Una foto firmada y dedicada de Ron Gilbert donde dice que no compres videojuegos de más de 20 $.</li>

<h4>3. Ya eres una pirata</h4>
<p>Pueden entregar las pruebas de que son auténticas piratas al mismo tiempo o por separado, pero hasta no haber cumplido las dos reglas y probarlo, no se les considerará piratas de pleno derecho y las <i><strong>Jefas Piratas</strong></i> solo les llamarán grumetes y/o marineras de agua dulce entre risas socarronas.</p>
<p>Tras conseguir tu barco y estar al otro lado de la ley, las PJ podrán solicitar su <i><strong>Título oficial de piratería</strong></i> que los identifica como piratas tras pagar la tasa correspondiente de un doblón de oro. Puede aprovechar esto para meterles nuevos retos como buscar calderilla debajo de la gramola de la taberna.</p>
<h4>4. Robar al gobernador</h4>
<p>A lo largo de las escenas anteriores tus jugadoras habrán oído hablar del gobernador, su caja fuerte y las inmensas cantidades de dinero que tiene en ella. Como no pueden ir a abordar barcos con su bote de remos, deberán buscar la forma de robar al gobernador para poder comprarse un barco pirata de verdad.</p>
<p>Cuando salgan de la Taberna del Cangrejo Cocido, puedes decirles que desde el puerto pueden acceder a la casa del Gobernador. De hecho, ahora en el puerto hay un neón gigante que pone «Visite el Museo del Gobernador Marlon, donde la magia de la democracia sucede».</p>
<h5>Exterior de la casa del gobernador</h5>
<p>La casa del Gobernador Marlon es una casa victoriana al lado de un acantilado que da al mar Caribe. Es lujosa y bien cuidada, seguramente el mantenimiento y los lujos como una <i><strong>estatua ecuestre del gobernador Marlon</strong></i> se paga con los impuestos de todos los habitantes de Bucan Ville.</p>
<p>Examinando su estatua, el gobernador Marlon es un excelente ejemplar de ser humano, larga melena, mentón cincelado con un hoyuelo divino, grandes hombros, torso esculpido en piedra y poderosos brazos y piernas.</p>
<p>El exterior está vigilado por unos <i><strong>pavos reales</strong></i> que gluglutean muy alto en cuanto te ven. Entonces una luz de la segunda planta se enciende y el gobernador Marlon sale a la ventana a vigilar armado con un rifle de pólvora negra. Cuando no ve nada sospechoso se vuelve a meter.</p>
<p>Si te escondes detrás de la <i><strong>estatua ecuestre</strong></i> y les golpeas cuando no miran hacia donde estás, puedes quitarles una <i><strong>pluma</strong></i>. Cuando tienes tres plumas, puedes hacerte un tocado de pavo real y los pavos reales te consideran uno de los suyos y te dejan pasar sin avisar al gobernador.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina odd" id="anchor25"></div><div class='columns'>
<h5>Hall principal de la casa del gobernador</h5>
<p>Al entrar a la casa del gobernador se accede al hall principal. Es grande y lujoso, lleno de obras de arte, jarrones caros, figuras de marfil, etc. El <i><strong>hall</strong></i> está levemente iluminado por unas pocas <i><strong>velas de la una gran lámpara de araña</strong></i>.</p>
<p>Si tratan de Tirar/Empujar las <i><strong>poleas que suben y bajan la lámpara</strong></i>, estas chirriarán y se verán luces desde el piso superior y sonidos del gobernador Marlon cargando su rifle. Eso hace que sea imposible bajar la lámpara mientras haga ruido, necesitan algún tipo de lubricante.</p>
<p>Déjales que busque por las pantallas algo que no sea clicables y que sirva de lubricante, como el grog que beben las <i><strong>Jefas Piratas</strong></i>, el aguarrás que usa el <i><strong>pintor</strong></i> de la <i><strong>Plaza Mayor</strong></i>, etc. y que lo conviertan en clicable con sus píxeles.</p>
<h5>Sótano de la casa del gobernador</h5>
<p>En el sótano está oscuro y solo se vislumbra la gran puerta de la <i><strong>caja fuerte</strong></i> con un montón cerraduras, ruedas con combinaciones y engranajes para girar. Parece muy complicada, tan complicada que el gobernador Marlon ha dejado una nota escondida en un pixel exacto de la pantalla con las instrucciones para abrir la caja fuerte.</p>
<p>Hay muy poca luz en el sótano y solo podrán encontrar el píxel exacto, si consiguen luz. La única fuente de luz será las <i><strong>velas de la lámpara de araña</strong></i> del <i><strong>hall principal</strong></i>.</p>
<h4>5. ¿El final?</h4>
<p>Cuando hayan conseguido entrar en la caja fuerte del gobernador y estén nadando en oro y joyas, oirán un fuerte cañonazo y de repente una bala cañón derrumbará una de las paredes. </p>
<p>Mientras se recuperan de la explosión verán como el temible capitán vampirata DraChuckla entrará por el agujero con sus secuaces ghouls para llevarse su botín mientras se ríe de ellos.</p>
<p>Se acercará a las PJ, les quitará un pelo a cada una y los pegará a unos muñecos vudú, diciendo «Por si acaso se convierten en un problema» y entonces caerán inconscientes.</p>
<p>Cuando consiguen levantarse verán por el agujero de la pared que el navío de velas negras que había a lo lejos del puerto se aleja con DraChuckla a bordo y el gobernador Marlon atado y amordazado.</p>
<h3>Disquetes II y III</h3>
<p>Aquí tienes algunas ideas de cómo puedes continuar esta AG que podrían abarcar el disco 2 (el nudo de la trama) y el disco 3 (el desenlace final).</p>
<ul>
<li>Pueden tratar de rescatar al gobernador de las garras de DraChuckla.</li>
<li>Pueden tratar de buscar el Mac’n Cheese, el tesoro pirata más grande conocido. Se rumorea que DraChuckla lo busca, así que deben ser cuidadosos.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="saltopagina even" id="anchor26"></div><div class='columns'>
<ul>
<li>Pueden intentar aprender magia vudú para ver si pueden contrarrestar lo que les haga DraChuckla con sus muñecos.</li>
<li>Tal vez, monten un grupo musical y se dediquen a hacer Reggae por todo el Caribe.</li>
</ul>
