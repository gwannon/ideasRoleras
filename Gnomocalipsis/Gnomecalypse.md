# Gnomocalypse [by Gwannon](https://gwannon.itch.io/gnomocalipsis-breathless)

Gnomocalypse is a one-page setting for [Breathless RPG System](https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/breathless-srd) about a community of Icelandic gnomes who must survive a zombie apocalypse.

## What has happened?

Hofði Forest in Iceland was a peaceful place where a community of gnomes lived, far from the eyes of humans. They lived in peace and harmony until a zombie apocalypse ravaged the land.

Although they are immune to the zombie disease, they have now to survive the attacks of zombies that enter in their forest to devour their flesh.

The gnomes were almost invisible to humans, except for some children, but, unlike humans, zombies can see them and, above all, smell their fresh flesh. When they encounter a gnome community, they destroy it and eat all its inhabitants.

And not only do they have to face zombies, the climate has gone to hell, and the world is a perpetual winter, making survival much more difficult.

## Creating Your Gnome

When creating a gnome, you must divide a d10, a d8 and a d6 among the six Breathless skills. A gnome’s stress is 4, and they have two stunts: one exclusively for interacting with zombies and another for interacting with everything else.

They are proportionally stronger than a human and can therefore carry 4 items in their backpack and a medical kit. Additionally, as they are excellent foragers, they start each adventure with an extra d8 human item.

## Daily Life

Life is very hard for the Hofði community. Attacks by giant zombies are becoming more frequent, and getting food is very difficult.

Zombies have wiped out almost all terrestrial wildlife, and the disappearance of humans has caused millions of ecological disasters across the planet, sending the climate into disarray. The gnomes live in a continuous winter, rarely seeing the sun, with constant rain and snow.

Getting food is the community’s main problem, and they are increasingly having to travel farther and take greater risks to get food.

Another pressing problem is the loss of unity. There are starting to appear groups that want to move to other places, regardless of those who cannot fend for themselves. There are also those who do not share their loot and those who believe the council of elders should be dissolved and they should rule with an iron fist.

## Catch Your Breath

To catch your breath, you will need to **be able to camp and rest**, and that can be done as long as there are no **zombies nearby** and you can find a dry, covered place to make fire.

## Fight against the zombies

**There is no way to fight a zombie,** they are gigantic monsters that move slowly and devour everything in their path.

But you can **distract** them and draw their attention elsewhere, or **lock them up** in a room, or **immobilize** them with a trap.

Think on it: for a gnome, a zombie is like a human encountering a horde of zombies. Gnomes can not destroy them; they can divert them or dodge them, but they can never fight them.

### Movement and Size

Gnomes are incredibly fast, so they were almost imperceptible to humans. If you add to that the slowness of zombies, for the gnomes it is as if they were moving at the speed of glaciers.

This is the great advantage that allows them to confront and defend themselves against them. Thanks to this, the gnomes can dodge their clumsy attacks, climb up their rags, run between their feet, and attempt other crazy schemes.

Another thing to keep in mind is the difference between sizes. A gnome is about 7 inches tall, 12 times smaller than a zombie. This means that any zombie attack is fatal. If you do not dodge it or if it catches you, you will end up devoured.

If your gnomes **lose all their stress in front of a zombie**, they will be caught and **devoured by a zombie**.

### Defenses and weapons

As we have already mentioned, weapons are not effective against zombies, only against other creatures such as rabid rats or hungry seagulls.

The only effective means of combating zombies are defenses and traps. For example, in Hofði, there is a security perimeter that rings tin cans and bells when a zombie approaches. There are also several spiked pit traps that lure zombies into to kill them.

## A world for humans

When you master, you must keep in mind that, when they leave the forest and enter the cities, they will be in a world designed only for humans.

Going up stairs is a very difficult climb, but hiding behind an old refrigerator is quite easy.

You should never forget that idea. To visualize it, a gnome with his hat is around 8 inches tall, and a stairstep is also about 8 inches tall.

## Types of zombies (1d12)

**1-4 - Fresh:** Recently killed zombies are as fast as a human, as their flesh is not rotten or dry, and they are usually whole.

**5-8 - Rotten:** They have been moving for years, are very dry, and are missing many parts. They are slower than a human, but their sense of smell is better, and their hunger for fresh meat makes them very dangerous and stubborn.

**9-10 - Legless:** They are very slow, and you can easily escape from them, but they are not easily distracted, and if they find a good spot, they can stay for days in front of the hole in the wall where you are hiding.

**11 - Siamese twins:** Two zombies that are together for some reason, perhaps their ribs caught or they are tangled in some kind of wire fence, etc. They are dangerous because they have more arms and mouths than a normal zombi, but they have troubles when they move, because each zombie goes in a different direction.

**12 - Another one:** There is an additional zombie. Reroll the current and additional zombie classes. If three zombies accumulate, this option is disabled.

## Loot and human technology

In Gnomocalypse there are two types of loot, forest and human.

### Forest loot

In the forest, you can find natural resources such as acorn shells that you can use as helmets, fire tinder, and so on.

With a d6 loot roll of 11-12, you can find a small animal such as mice, moles, or sparrows that you can use as equipment and that does not take up space in your backpack. If used against zombies, they will disappear after the roll as if all their uses had been used.

Forest loot is only found in areas where humans were not present.

### Human loot

Gnomes have always considered human technology an affront to nature, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and groups of gnomes will raid abandoned human buildings to snatch useful technology.

You should remember that human loot is only useful if it does not use electricity or is battery-powered. A wind-up alarm clock works fine and can be set to go off at a certain time, luring a zombie into a trap.

Human loot is found in areas where humans once lived and also on zombie corpses.

Human technology takes up two spaces in your backpack, but it is very useful against zombies, so it has one more level when rolled, although it retains its normal level when spent.

### Medical kits

**Medical kits** are poultices and infusions of healing forest herbs and can only be obtained in the forest. Human medicines are of no use to gnomes.

### Examples of loots

Let’s look at some examples of loots.

|Human loot|Forest loot|
|---|---|
|Cords|Vines|
|Flareons|Honey and wax|
|Fuel|Dry tinder|
|Alarm clock|Berries and nuts|
|Matches|Torch-making materials|
|Flashlight|Boat-making wood|
|Firecrackers|Feathers and animal hair|
|Glue|Tree resin|
|Plastic container|Tree bark|
|Knives and cutlery|Mushrooms and fungi|

## Adventure seeds

* A group of explorer gnomes has not returned from their last search; perhaps they have been devoured by a zombie, perhaps they are lost, or perhaps they are injured.
* The steel cable you use on the commune’s security perimeter needs to be replaced; you will have to go to the nearby town to get new cable.
* A zombie horde is approaching your forest; if they enter, they will ravage everything. Perhaps you could set up one of those noisy, fetid metal monsters that humans used to travel, attract their attention and draw them away from the forest.
* A group of explorers returns with unusual news: outside the edge of the forest, a small community of human survivors has formed a camp. What should your gnomes do? Hide, communicate with them, or expel them?
