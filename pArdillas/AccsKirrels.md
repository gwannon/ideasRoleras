# s**K**irrels [by Gwannon](https://gwannon.com/)

«sKirrels» is a **one-page RPG** where you will be a crazy squirrel who lives in a park of a big city. Your adventures will consist of getting food from walkers in the park and avoiding dangers such as dogs, cats or fire.

## Your sKirrels' park

In this game, you'll play as a sKirrel who lives in a huge park in a large city. The park is vast, with paths, meadows, gardens, lakes with boats, fountains, greenhouses, street food carts, sports fields, and more.

The adventures you'll experience there will almost always be about getting food, often by stealing it from walkers (people wandering through the park). Other times, they'll have to escape dangers like domestic cats or dogs, or even prevent fires. Finally, you might have to deal with the weird and crazy things that people visiting the park sometimes do.

> If you want to set the mood for your game, you can find a map of a famous park like the Retiro Park in Madrid, Park Güell in Barcelona, Central Park in New York, or Hyde Park in London and use it in your adventures.

## Game system

When we say «peanut», we are referring to a in-shell peanut and when we are talking about «seeds», we are referring to the seeds inside a in-shell peanut.

To play sKirrels you only need **pencil, paper and a bag of in-shell peanuts**.

### Rolls

When the game begins, you must place a good handful of peanuts (15 or 20) in a deep bowl or some kind of sack. Each time a roll is made, the player/GM must randomly take a peanut and crack it open. The number of seeds inside will determine the value of the roll.

|Seeds|Result|
|---|---|
|1|**Failure:** What you were trying to do fails, and that failure has consequences.|
|2|**Success with Consequence:** What you were trying to do succeeds, but has consequences.|
|3|**Success without Consequence:** What you were trying to do succeeds.|
|4 or more|**Critical Success:** What you were trying to do succeeds exceptionally, and you should gain some advantage. If you collect 5 seeds, you can save 1, and it's still a critical.|
Players can modify any of their rolls by stuffing the seeds they don't need into the cheek pouches like squirrels and removing them whenever it suits them. The GM is not allowed to do this.

If there are any spoiled seeds among the seeds, it's always a botch. You can avoid botching them by eating them along with all the seeds you have in your cheek pouches. Remember, squirrels do these things. A **botch means that everything that could go wrong will go wrong**, so be creative with what happens to the unfortunate squirrel.

When the bag runs out of peanuts, put a new handful in. Obviously, you can cheat by trying to grab the largest peanuts, but remember that as the game progresses, only smaller peanuts will remain, and therefore, with fewer seeds.

> Any seeds left over from the throws that are not sucked up can be left in another bowl for the game director to eat.

### Consequences, fear and damage

When a sKirrel receives a consequence, it can take several forms, from losing something important or being spotted by predators to being harmed or scared. The consequences must be logical within the current action.

Squirrels are skittish and fragile creatures, so when the director decides that **the consequences they receive are being scared or hurt**, they run away and hide in their burrow for a full scene. During that **lost scene**, they will calm down or heal from their injuries and be ready for the next scene.

Therefore, if a house cat scares your sKirrel, you won't be able to act in the next scene where they try to steal the keys of the park snack cart, but they will return for the next scene when they try to use the key to steal the pecan nuts from the cart.

> While your sKirrel rests in its burrow, it eats all the seeds in its mouth. So it will have its cheek pouches when it starts the next scene.

### Tongue clicks, hisses and squeaks

Your game table can't speak normally when they're playing their sKirrels and talking to each other; **they can only click their tongues, hisses, and make small squeaks**. However, they can speak normally when they address the GM and explain what they want to do.

Squirrel language is very simple. Here are its basic principles.

* **1 tongue click:** Yes
* **2 tongue clicks:** No
* **1 squeak:** Danger
* **2 squeaks:** Food
* **1 hiss:** Well, here I am. What are your other two wishes?
* **2 hisses:** Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir) ?
* **1 click + 1 squeak:** Tree up
* **1 squeak + 1 hiss:** Tree down
* **1 hiss + 1 click:** Don't move

If a sKirrel lose seeds from the cheek pouches while clicking, hissing or squeaking, they can't be recovered.

A sKirrel can use mime to communicate more complex ideas, like cartoon squirrels do. You have two or three attempts to make yourself understood, and if you are unsuccessful, you must stop miming and let your treemates act.
## Creating your sKirrel

When creating your sKirrel, you only need to choose the color of the fur on its body (head and back), ears, belly and tail. You can only repeat a color once. This will give you several advantages in the game.

|&nbsp;|White|Black|Red|Grey|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Body:** You can return a peanut you just picked up before opening it by …|dodging predators.|moving unseen.|trying to understand what the walker are doing.|jumping and climbing.|
|**Ears:** You can achieve success without consequences without taking a peanut when …|seducing other rodents.|lying to other rodents.|listening.| negotiating with other rodents.|
|**Belly:** If you swallow all the peanuts in your cheek pouches (at least one), you can … until the end of the scene.|speak normally to the rest of sKirrels|understand the symbols that the walkers put in the park|communicate with non-rodents|use a simple gadget that the walkers you've seen using|
|**Tail:** If you roll successfully, …|walkers can't take their eyes off you because you are so adorable.|predators think you're some kind of stunted skunk and run away.|you can swim great distances and even dive to get underwater items.|you can get close to the fire, even pick up some briquettes or walk through a flame.|

> There can never be two sKirrels with the same combination of colors and body parts.

## Hazards in the park

These are some of the risks you can find in the park.

### Cats

Deadly nocturnal hunters, but they lose interest quickly.

> Whenever they confront cats, the consequences will be that they will receive damage or be scared.

### Crows and ravens

These black birds are very wise, especially a court of crows. They know how to talk to all kinds of creatures.

> They always demand a payment their services, as food, shiny things, etc.

### Dogs

These diurnal hunters with an excellent sense of smell go crazy for squirrels and are almost always tied to a walker.

> If they are loose, they will not stop chasing the sKirrel that they detect.

### Fire and electricity

sKirrels do not approach these dangers.It can be barbecues, fire-eating shows, forest fires and/or electric cables broken by the wind.

> Whenever they face fire and/or electricity, the consequences will be that they will take damage or be scared.

### Walkers

These huge creatures move erratically around the park doing their weird things. Don't try to understand what they do, it doesn't make much sense.

> The consequences of dealing with walkers do not have to have any logic.

### Other rodents

We are talking about rats, mouses, hamsters and even rabbits.

> They are like squirrels that don't climb trees.

## Adventure seeds

This list of ideas can be used as a basis for your adventures.

* You don't know why, but since they put some metal plates in the park, walkers give you less food. Maybe the Crow Council of the Great Picnic Prairie will know what's up.
* A cousin from the forest has come to spend a few days with you, but she is not prepared for life in the park and keeps getting into trouble.
* There are a lot of walkers with strange clothes, fighting for giant white walnuts (a sunday morning party of whatever sport you want). If your sKirrels steal one of those nuts, they'll have food for weeks.
