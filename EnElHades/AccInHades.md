# In Hades

#### «In Hades» is a solo role-playing game about Greek mythology based on Firelights.## Your story so far …

You have descended into the underworld **to rescue the love of your life**. After much effort and hardship, Persephone has taken pity on you, accepted your flatteries, your gifts, and your compliments, and has returned your lost love.

But there's a trick: your loved one doesn't remember you. Hades has stolen the six most important memories she had of you and your love.

Before you can leave the Underworld with your soulmate, you must enter the shadowy world of the dead with the torch given to you by a _lampade_, a nymph of the Afterlife, and recover all the important memories she had of you, which Hades has hidden in his realm.

Throughout your wanderings, you will be harassed by demons, demonic servants of the lord of the underworld.

## PREPARING THE GAME

To play this game, you will need the following materials:

* A standard deck of cards without any jokers. You will use this as a way to guide the story, and its challenges. This is your **Story Deck**. When you use a card, discard it.
* Two six-sided dice. You will use these to perform actions in the narrative, and get answers about the world. These are your **Action Dice**.
* A notebook to act as your **Journey Book** for log entries.
* Index cards or random slips of paper.
* A token of some sort (coin, poker chip, etc.).

Shuffle and place your Story Deck on a flat surface, and gather your Action Dice.

### Create your character

Choose your name, preferred pronouns and the name of your soulmate. Your character has three approaches. Assign one to a +2, another with a +1, the third defaults to a 0.

* **Strong** like Hercules.
* **Clever** like Ulysses.
* **Trickster** like Orpheus.

Finally, decide where you begin your journey.

* **Elysium (Light),** the paradise of heroes
* **Asphodel Meadows (Shade),** the place of anonymous souls
* **Tartarus (Darkness),** the hell of the villains

## THE GAME

### Making An Action

Actions guide your journey across the underworld. Each one is a self-contained system which helps you resolve the questions you have, or the actions you want to take.

When making an Action, go through the following:

* Draw 2 cards face-up from your Story Deck.
* Roll and sum your two Action Dice.
* Add any modifiers to your roll to get your Score.

Interpret the result as follows, then discard the cards.

* If your score is **higher than both cards**, there’s **Light**.
* If your score is **higher than one card**, there’s **Shade**.
* Otherwise, there’s **Darkness**.

Aces are worth 1, Jacks are worth 11, Queens are worth 12, and Kings are worth 13. Each Action is formatted Actions+(Modifier), and tells you what happens when there’s Light, Shade or Darkness. Modifiers can be your approach, golden apples or anything else.
### Exploring The World

When you start the game, draw a card from the Story Deck, and place it face up in front of you. This is where you are right now. As you discover the land, you will add more cards to your World Map. Each card being a new region.

When you add a new region card, the corner of your card needs to connect with another region’s corner. To know whether the region you are adding is located below, beside or above your current location, compare the numbers of both cards, and interpret the result.

* If the number on the new card is higher than the one on your current location, place the card above.
* If the number on the new card is lower than the one on your current location, place the card below.
* Otherwise, place the card beside your current location.
* If the new card you place face up **is an Ace or K**, you have entered a **new zone of Hades**. Choose which new zone you arrive randomly (even numbered in one zone, odd numbered in the other).

Use RANDOM TABLES for inspiration, place slips of paper on top of the cards to note down details about the region.

### Recovering Memories

To locate memories, DISCOVER A REGION. If the card you add is a face card (jack, queen, or king), there is one.

### Remembering and Forgetting

In Hades, you are only memories of your life, and you must try to preserve them. When the Forgetting track (with 5 spaces) is full or the Story Deck empty, it's time to stop and remember; otherwise, your character would end up seeing their very essence extinguished.

When you stop to remember, write an extra entry in your travel journal, shuffle the cards discarded during your journey with those in the Story Deck, and clear your Forgetting track.

### Fighting _daemons_

If you encounter a _daemon_, you may confront them. Build a stack of cards as described in the FIGHT A _DAEMON_ action. When the number of cards of the stack matches the _daemon_’s Strength (STR), they fade away and perish. If you flee from a _daemon_, their stack persists until you encounter them again.

* **Minor _daemon_ (STR 5):** These spirits or shadows, concepts like old age, fear or poverty, and in that way they torment you. Spades (♠) count as two stack cards.
* **Erinyes/Furies (STR 8):** They represent revenge for crimes. They are winged women, with snakes in their hair and carrying a torch or a whip. Black cards (♠ ♣) count as two stack cards.
* **Judge (STR 10):** These sons of Zeus judge souls and decide which part of Hades they are sent to. Red cards (♦ ♥) count as two stack cards.
* **Cerberus (STR 13):** The terrible two-headed hound that never sleeps and guards the gates of the Afterlife. Hearts (♥) count as two stack cards.

### Names

If at any time, when **writing your love's name in your diary, you don't remember it**, you will have forgotten them forever and won't remember why you are in Hades, so you will have to leave the underworld.

If at any time, when **writing your name in your diary, you don't remember it**, you will have lost all your memories and will remain trapped in Hades's domain for all eternity.

### Recalling Memories

When you find a memory, you can recall it by drawing a card at random from the discard pile, as memories are things that have already happened. Based on the card, you can construct the memory.

|Suit|Memory kind|
|---|---|
|Hearts (♥)|Lovely memories|
|Spades (♠)|Conflicts|
|Clovers (♣)|Fortuitous events|
|Diamonds (♦)|Family and friends|

The number of the card also has a meaning:

|Number|Meaning|Number|Meaning|
|---|---|---|---|
|Ace|First|8|Comfort|
|2|Doubts|9|Ex-partner|
|3|Home|10|Last|
|4|Details|J|Illness|
|5|Poverty|Q|War|
|6|Wealth|K|Death|
|7|Gifts|—|—|

So the **Ace of Hearts** (First/Love) can be your **first kiss** and the **King of Spades** (Death/Conflict) a **mortal confrontation with another person for your soulmate**.
