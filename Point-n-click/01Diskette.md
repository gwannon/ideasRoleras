## Floppy disk 1/3: How to be a pirate

&nbsp;

\conc

Your PCs have just arrived in Bucan Ville, a pirate haven, with the intention of becoming pirates themselves and making a fortune through piracy.

This part is divided into four scenes. The first will be a brief introduction. Then there will be two parallel scenes: one in which the _**Pirate Lady Bosses**_ grant them the _**pirate degree**_ after they pass a test, and another in which they acquire a ship and its flag. The fourth scene will be the heist of the governor's safe.

### 1. The beginning

The PJs appear at nightfall in the harbour of Bucan Ville and will shout «My name is [PJ name] and I want to be a pirate».

#### Harbour

In this filthy, seedy harbour, there's only one place to go: the _**Boiled Crab Tavern**_, a pirate's den where the grog is watered down and the snacks and peanuts were once Blackbeard's cabin boys.

In the distance, a _**ship with tattered black sails**_ can be seen. An eerie glow floods its deck, and flocks of bats circle overhead.

From the port, you can access _**Bucan Ville Town Center**_.

\sp

#### Boiled Crab Tavern

The place is a dingy old dive, packed with _**drunken pirates. The few who aren't sleeping off their hangovers can barely manage a sentence:

* So you want to be a pirate, huh? Talk to the three _**Pirate Ladybosses**_.
* The grog in my day was real grog, not like the stuff they make now with little umbrellas, cloves, and mint leaves. We used to put real cloves in it.
* Have you heard of [Ahoy! Cthulhu](https://arrrcthulhu.com/)? It's an excellent setting for pirate adventures in a Caribbean of the Cthulhu Mythos.
* They stole my idea for the monkey-traffic light. I could have been a millionaire and retired to a Caribbean island and spent my days drinking grog. Oops, I already do that.

At a large table in the back sit the _**3 Pirate Ladybosses**_. The most powerful pirates of Bucan Ville, chosen by the democratic method of slaughtering all their competition.

These three rude pirates are at the table, drinking grog and singing bawdy songs. When your players explain that they want to be pirates, they'll laugh a lot and tell them to stop wasting their time and go back to what they were doing.

Your players will have to prove they really want to be pirates by answering questions like these:

* What was Stede Bonnet's nickname? - Gentleman pirate

\sc

* What was Blackbeard's flag? - A horned skeleton holding an hourglass in its right hand and a spear in its left, using the spear to pierce a red heart that drips three drops of red blood.
* What was the name of Blackbeard's first ship? - Queen Anne's Revenge.

They'll also make them sing "Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum" (which your players will have to sing). After a while trying to prove they deserve a test, they agree to take the standardized pirate guild exam, which consists of two tests:

* You must prove you're on the other side of the law.
* You must own your own self-propelled ship and create your own unique, personalized pirate flag.

After explaining the standardized tests, they will be asked to sign some paperwork and given a _**discount voucher**_ for the _**Souvenir Shop**_. If they ask for any hints, they will simply be told to ask for _**Sam**_ at the shipyard to see what they can offer in terms of ships.

On the table of the  _**three Pirate Ladybosses**_, there is a _**fruit bowl**_ with oranges, bananas, apples, Swiss vitamin C candies, and lemons, which they claim are from their scurvy eradication campaign.

If they ask, they can take _**a piece of fruit**_. Choose one at random and give it to them. If they eat it, they can ask for another. Until they finish the other piece of fruit they took, the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ will tell them to finish it first.

\sp

### 2.a Cross over to the other side of the law

As the Pirate laady Bosses explained, to become a pirate, you need to be on the other side of the law and have proof of it.

There are several ways to commit crimes:

* The easiest way is to run the red light at the monkey traffic light in _**Bucan Ville's Main Square**_.
* Another way is to stand to the left of the _**courthouse**_ while the _**painter**_ in the _**Main Square**_ is painting.
* If you try other kind of crimes, your characters will look at the screen and say things like, «My mother didn't raise a petty thief» or «This would put me on Santa's naughty list.»

If you see them getting lost at this point, emphasize the "other side of the law" part or remind them of the drunken pirate in the Boiled Crab Tavern who claimed to have invented the monkey traffic light and ask them for a clue.

#### Bucan Ville's Town Center

The streets of the Town Center are deserted at night, the gas lamps are lit, and the shops are closed—all except the _**souvenir shop**_ with its large neon sign that reads "Open 24 Hours."

To cross the street that runs through the center, you have to go through a pedestrian crossing controlled by a _**monkey-traffic light**_ and watched over by a _**city guard**_ who only says, "Move along, move along!" The monkey-traffic light is operated by a monkey that changes the color of the light by moving levers. When you approach, the monkey moves the levers, and you always cross on green.

No matter how hard you try, the monkey always sets it to green. The only way to cross on red is to give the monkey a banana when the light is red, and as it eats the banana, it stays red. At that moment you can cross and the _**city guard**_ will give you a _**fine**_ and, therefore, you will be an outlaw.

#### Bucan Ville's Main Square

The Plaza Mayor is like all plazas, a large, empty cobblestone space with a single _**dead tree**_ in the center bearing a sign that reads "Tree for Hanging Pirates - Closed for Renovations."

Next to the tree is a _**painter**_ who is painting the town hall. He paints the pictures at lightning speed and leaves them in a _**pile**_ beside him. If you examine them closely, you'll see they aren't very good.

If you try to talk to him, he'll tell you he's very busy; he has to paint 1,000 identical pictures of the town hall for the fundraising campaign for the governor's reelection.

\sp

Next to the town hall is the _**courthouse**_. As you approach, you'll see that it's open from midnight to midnight, except on weekends when it's closed. If you stand to its left before the painter starts a new painting and wait until they finish, you can pick up a painting that shows you next to the courthouse—that is, on the other side of the law, just as the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ requested.

On the other side of the town hall, you can access a _**dark alley**_ from which random snippets of a conversation emerge.

#### Dark alley

It's just a trap. When they enter, the voices will fall silent and figures will vanish into the shadows. As soon as they step back out into the plaza, the voices will return.

### 2.b Get a pirate ship and flag

The only place on the island that sells boats is the _**shipyard**_, and the only one your players can afford right now is a rowboat. The problem is, it's not self-propelled, so they'll have to find a way to make a sail for it.

For the sail fabric, they just need to get the _**Twister vinyl**_ from the _**souvenir shop**_. The mast will simply be one of the oars, and they'll have to tell _**Sam**_, the _**shipyard**_ manager, their idea.

They might waste pixels converting non-clickable elements into clickable ones, like rugs, sheets, etc. When they take it to Sam, he'll make up some silly excuse.

If they present the rowboat's _**title deed**_ to the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ without a sail, they'll fail the test, shouting in unison, "It's not self-propelled!"

The flag isn't a challenge; let them use whatever they find to make their flag, and if you can make it as ridiculous as possible, even better. They can use the discount _**voucher**_ at the _**souvenir shop**_, and the shop assistant can give them any silly thing you can think of to use for their flag.


#### Shipyard

From the _**Main Square**_, you can access the Bucan Ville _**shipyards**_, where your players can acquire a boat they can afford.

There they'll find _**Sam**_, a nautical geek with thick glasses and a t-shirt that says, "Kiss me, I'm a model ship builder."

_**Sam**_ lives to design and build ships... to scale (he always says this quietly), and since he hasn't been able to dedicate himself to building them, he sells them.

Despite being a main character and being able to talk about many topics, _**Sam**_ only talks about ships, ship design, the history of navigation, nautical trivia, etc. If you try to talk about something else, he steers the conversation back to ships.

\sp

If they tell him they want to buy a ship, he'll offer them what he has in stock: a luxury pirate ship, a second-hand pirate ship, and a fishing boat. When your players explain their financial situation—that is, 0 doubloons—he'll take them to one side of the shipyard and show them an old _**rowboat**_ with a broken oar.

_**Sam**_ will say that the _**luxury pirate ship_** costs so many gold doubloons that only by robbing the _**governor's safe_** could they afford it, but it's pure luxury. In fact, the wheel even has its own ebony coaster. The problem no one saw coming is that when you turn it, it flips over and spills all the drinks.

After tough negotiations, _**Sam**_ will agree to 200 gold doubloons to be paid with their first act of piracy and plunder. He'll give them the _**title deed**_ to the _**rowboat**_ and a _**pile of papers specifying the payment method**_, which they mustn't lose.

To make it self-propelled, they'll need something to serve as a mast and something to serve as a sail. There's a strike by sailmakers and mast makers, and he's out of them, so your players will have to find something to replace it.

As we've already mentioned, for the sail they'll need the _**Twister vinyl**_ decal and for the mast the oar that isn't broken. With these, _**Sam**_ will assemble some sails and change the description on the _**title deed**_.

#### Souvenir shop

_**Maxine**_ the Red, the red-haired terror of the Caribbean, retired from piracy and used her earnings to open a souvenir shop selling famous pirate memorabilia in Bucan Ville. In her shop, you can find the most outlandish items from the pirate world, from a lock of Blackbeard's beard to Sir Francis Drake's mouthguard.

When customers try to buy a clickable item, Maxine will tell some strange story to discourage them, such as that it's riddled with woodworm or belonged to a leper.

The only thing in the shop that could serve as a sail is a _**Twister vinyl**_ Pirate Edition with skulls, crossbones, treasure chests, and cannons instead of the colored circles.

Like most things in her shop, she doesn't want to give the _**Twister vinyl**_ because it reminds him of when he used to "play" (wink, wink, knock, knock) Twister with Anne Bonny, Jack Rackham, and Mary Read aboard the "Ranger."

The _**discount voucher**_ the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ gave them has a typo, and if you take Lulock Holmes's _**magnifying glass**_ —Lulock Holmes being Sherlock Holmes's Caribbean cousin and the first pirate detective in literature— you can read the fine print. Where it should say, "Presenting this voucher will get you a 50% discount on pirate merchandise OR a 50% discount on board games," it actually says, "Presenting this voucher will get you a 50% discount on pirate merchandise AND a 50% discount on board games."

\sp

So they can use the _**discount voucher**_ to get the _**Twister vinyl**_ completely free and Maxine can't refuse because the truth is that it's the most useless and cheapest thing she has in the store.

Ideas for other silly and weird things you might have in the shop that you could add as clickable items, but that Maxine doesn't want to sell because they bring back fond memories:

* Blackbeard's red beard curls
* Sir Francis Drake's dental splint
* Anne Bonny action figure with a karate chop, red-light eyes, and a button that makes her say, "If you had fought like a man, you wouldn't be hanged like a dog now"
* Long John Silver's running peg leg
* Unofficial Pirates of the Caribbean merchandise signed by the main characters' stunt doubles
* A signed and dedicated photo of Ron Gilbert saying not to buy video games over $20.

### 3. You're a Pirate Now

Players can submit proof of their pirate status simultaneously or separately, but until they've fulfilled both requirements and proven it, they won't be considered full-fledged pirates. The _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ will only refer to them as cabin boys and/or landlubbers with mocking laughter.

After acquiring their ship and being on the wrong side of the law, the player characters can apply for their official __**Pirate Certificate**_, which identifies them as pirates, after paying the corresponding fee of one gold doubloon. You can use this as an opportunity to introduce new challenges, such as searching for loose change under the tavern's jukebox.

### 4. Robar al gobernador

A lo largo de las escenas anteriores tus jugadoras habrán oído hablar del gobernador, su caja fuerte y las inmensas cantidades de dinero que tiene en ella. Como no pueden ir a abordar barcos con su bote de remos, deberán buscar la manera de robar al gobernador para poder comprarse un barco pirata de verdad.

Cuando salgan de la Taberna del Cangrejo Cocido, puedes decirles que desde el puerto pueden acceder a la casa del Gobernador. De hecho, ahora en el puerto hay un neón gigante que pone «Visite el Museo del Gobernador Marlon, donde la magia de la democracia sucede».

#### Exterior de la casa del gobernador

La casa del Gobernador Marlon es una casa victoriana al lado de un acantilado que da al mar Caribe. Es lujosa y bien cuidada, seguramente el mantenimiento y los lujos como una _**estatua ecuestre del gobernador Marlon**_ se paga con los impuestos de todos los habitantes de Bucan Ville.

\sp

Examinando su estatua, el gobernador Marlon es un excelente ejemplar de ser humano, larga melena, mentón cincelado con un hoyuelo divino, grandes hombros, torso esculpido en piedra y poderosos brazos y piernas.

El exterior está vigilado por unos _**pavos reales**_ que gluglutean muy alto en cuanto te ven. Entonces una luz de la segunda planta se enciende y el gobernador Marlon sale a la ventana a vigilar armado con un rifle de pólvora negra. Cuando no ve nada sospechoso se vuelve a meter.

Si te escondes detrás de la _**estatua ecuestre**_ y les golpeas cuando no miran hacia donde estás, puedes quitarles una _**pluma**_. Cuando tienes tres plumas, puedes hacerte un _**tocado de pavo real**_ y los _**pavos reales**_ te consideran uno de los suyos y te dejan pasar sin avisar al gobernador.

#### Hall principal de la casa del gobernador

Al entrar a la casa del gobernador se accede al hall principal. Es grande y lujoso, lleno de obras de arte, jarrones caros, figuras de marfil, etc. El _**hall**_ está levemente iluminado por unas pocas _**velas de la una gran lámpara de araña**_.

Si tratan de Tirar/Empujar las _**poleas que suben y bajan la lámpara**_, estas chirriarán y se verán luces desde el piso superior y sonidos del gobernador Marlon cargando su rifle. Eso hace que sea imposible bajar la lámpara mientras haga ruido, necesitan algún tipo de lubricante.

Déjales que busque por las pantallas algo que no sea clicables y que sirva de lubricante, como el grog que beben las _**Jefas Piratas**_, el aguarrás que usa el _**pintor**_ de la _**Plaza Mayor**_, etc. y que lo conviertan en clicable con sus píxeles.

##### Sótano de la casa del gobernador

En el sótano está oscuro y solo se vislumbra la gran puerta de la _**caja fuerte**_ con un montón de cerraduras, ruedas con combinaciones y engranajes para girar. Parece muy complicada, tan complicada que el gobernador Marlon ha dejado una nota escondida en un pixel exacto de la pantalla con las instrucciones para abrir la caja fuerte.

Hay muy poca luz en el sótano y solo podrán encontrar el píxel exacto, si consiguen luz. La única fuente de luz será las _**velas de la lámpara de araña**_ del _**hall principal**_. Si intentan traer alguna fuente de luz de otro sitio (convirtiendo algo en clicable), pónselo difícil, porque serán eléctricas o a gas.

### 5. Enter DraChuckla

Once they've managed to break into the governor's vault and are swimming in gold and jewels, they'll hear a loud cannon blast, and suddenly a cannonball will shatter one of the walls.

As they recover from the explosion, they'll see the fearsome vampire captain DraChuckla enter through the hole with his ghoul henchmen to seize their loot while laughing at them.

\sp

He'll approach the player characters, pluck a hair from each of them, and stick them to voodoo dolls, saying, "Just in case you become a problem," and then they'll fall unconscious.

When they manage to get up, they'll see through the hole in the wall that the black-sailed ship that was in the distance from the port is sailing away with DraChuckla on board and Governor Marlon bound and gagged.
