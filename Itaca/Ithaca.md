# Ithaca 

&nbsp;

\conc

Ithaca is a role-playing game based on **[Breathless](https://farirpgs.com/breathless/creator-kit)** for **one player and one gamemaster** where the player plays the Greek mythological character of Penelope.

Every day Penelope weaves a tapestry, and each night she must stealthily sneak around and entangle the suitors who prowl the palace, or evade them and undo all the work she has done during the day.

She has promised to choose a new husband and marry once the tapestry is finished. If she is caught, her ruse will be discovered, and she will have to marry.

```
Escape from your chambers, evade your suitors, and undo your tapestry.
```

## System

«Ithaca» uses the [Breathless](https://farirpgs.com/breathless/creator-kit) system, modifying and expanding its rules to capture the adventures in which Penelope will participate.

### Checks

When doing something challenging, you make a check to see how it plays out. You only need to roll if what you are doing is risky. The GM first telegraphs the risk of your action. You then pick a skill or item, and roll the die that matches its rating.

If an ally helps you, they also make a check, but share the same risks as you. Take the highest die and interpret the result.

|Check|Result|
|---|---|
|1-2|You fail, and there’s an additional complication.|
|3-4|You succeed, but there’s a complication.|
|5+|You succeed. The higher the result, the better the effect.|

\sp

Penelope's life is not easy despite being the queen of Ithaca. Everyone who rolled reduces the rating of the skill they used by one step. Skills cannot go lower than a D4.

> **D12 ⇾ D10 ⇾ D8 → D6 → D4**

The GM can also disclaim decision-making by testing for luck. To do so, pick a die rating simply based on the odds of a thing happening, roll, and interpret the result as you see fit.

### Stop and take a breathe (Catch Your Breath)

To regain all your abilities, you must "stop and take a breathe." This is a short break to calm down, review the situation, lower your heart rate, and return to the mission at full speed.

To stop and take a breathe, you must be **out of danger in a quiet place, away from the sight of the suitors**.

When Penelope stops and takes a breathe, the GM observes the situation and presents a new complication to the group.

### Provisioning (Loot Checks)

As you progress through the halls of your palace, you can stock up on items that will help you reach the tapestry and undo the work you've done.

When the history allows, you can 

\sc

make a provisioning roll to find equipment that will help you in your quest.

Be careful because you may encounter things you didn't want, such as a drunken suitor coming from the baths or one of the hunting hounds brought by a suitor seeking your hand.

The equipment you can search for is primarily everyday objects from a period house, but also weapons belonging to your ancestors, family treasures, and even items left behind by suitors, from their war helmet to a polished bronze mirror they brought as a gift for you.

To make a provisioning roll, you must roll a D12 and consult the following table.

|D12|Provisioning|
|---|---|
|1-2|Trouble is here…|
|3-4|There’s trouble ahead…|
|5-6|Add a D6 item|
|7-8|Add a D8 item|
|9-10|Add a D10 item or a jar of ambrosia|
|11-12|Add a D12 item or a jar of ambrosia|

If you're not sure what you'll get with the provisioning roll, you can roll a d20 on the following table or look up the most common items in each type of room where Penelope is later.

\sp

|D20|Item|
|---|---|
|1|Ouzo|
|2|Knife|
|3|Polished Metal Mirror|
|4|Metal Cutlery|
|5|Torch/Oil Lamp|
|6|Syrinx (Pan's Flute)|
|7|Rope|
|8|Rich Suitor's Garments|
|9|Marble Marbles|
|10|Oil Jar|
|11|Hand Sickle|
|12|Beeswax|
|13|Helmet|
|14|Theater Mask|
|15|Maid's Clothes|
|16|Honey Pot|
|18|Farmer's/Gardener's Clothes|
|19|Pitchfork|
|20|Poison|

#### Featured items

Aside from the typical things with their typical uses that you might find in an ancient Greek home, there are certain special objects you should keep in mind that can be used in very creative ways.

* **Ouzo:** This very strong spirit is the favorite alcoholic drink of suitors. It serves both to get them drunk and to distract them. No one will miss the opportunity to grab a jug of ouzo and drink it somewhere quiet. Ouzo is famous for leaving significant memory lapses the next day, so it's another of its abilities that can be called upon in a pinch.
* **Oil:** Oil has many uses. From throwing it on the floor to make people slip or using it as fuel to burn something, to smearing yourself with it to get through tight spaces.
* **Beeswax:** You can use it to seal objects and determine if they've been opened. You can also use it as glue and even to make molds of objects.
* **Marble Marbles:** This children's toy, which surely belonged to Telemachus or one of his friends, can be used as caltrops, as a projectile, or to throw to distract a guard or lookout.
* **Clothing:** The different clothing options will primarily allow you to disguise yourself, but, for example, you can also use it to make bandages or tie yourself up and lower yourself out of a window.
* **Syrinx:** This flute has an easily recognizable sound and is usually very common at celebrations and revelries. Any suitor who hears it will surely look for the location of that party he's been missing. And remember, music tames wild beasts, and some suitors have brought their best hunting hounds.

\sp

### Basket (Backpack)

The items in your basket can be used in place of your skills. They start with a die level that decreases after each use.

When reduced to a D4, the item breaks, is lost, or simply disappears from history.

Only **3 items and 1 jar of ambrosia may be carried in your basket**.

### Spartan training (Stunts)

Penelope is the daughter of the King of Sparta, and when things get tough, you can try calling on your Spartan training (yes, in this game, Spartan women receive military training like men) and **roll a D12** instead of your current skill rank.

Once your Spartan training is used up, **you can't use it again until you stop and take a breathe again**.

### Exhaustion (Stress)

When you face a consequence as a result of one of your actions, the GM may decide that Penelope receives 1 level of exhaustion.

If Penelope reaches 4 levels of exhaustion, she's exhausted and tired of having to do the same thing every night, waiting for a husband you don't know if he's alive or dead, or if he's trying to come back or not.

When you're exhausted, failing a dangerous action means you give up on your quest and possibly finish the tapestry and choose a suitor as everyone desires.

### Ambrosia (Medikits)

You can, at any time, drink the entire contents of a vat of ambrosia. The drink of the gods has invigorating and rejuvenating effects that will help you and allow you to remove 2 exhaustion points.

Alternatively, take cover in a safe place for a few seconds to rethink the situation and remove 1 exhaustion point. You can only do this once per night.

### Calling on maidens

Penelope is the queen of Ithaca, and as queen, all citizen, and especially her maidens, must obey her.

Throughout the night, your handmaids move around the palace, performing their duties and attending to the suitors, so you can call on them for help.

Service **works similarly to equipment**. Each handmaid *has a die that decreases in rank until it drops below D4** and disappears. However, in this case, Penelope doesn't know her initial or current rank; only the GM knows.

When you enter a room, the GM rolls a D12 and describes the maid she encounters. Also keep in mind that there may be events that indicate a room is empty, or that it's easier to find people and rooms that are always empty. 

\sp

For example, the wine cellar is always empty and shouldn't be home, but if the evening event is a banquet, maids will be constantly entering and leaving the wine cellar.

When describing the maid, try to provide information that helps estimate her current die range. For example, "She looks tired and dirty from working all day in the stables" could be a D4, "She moves the haystacks vigorously and quickly" could be a D10.

|D12|Maiden|
|---|---|
|1-2|Maid with a d6 bribed by a suitor|
|3-4|No maid|
|5-6|Maid with a D4|
|7-8|Maid with a D6|
|9-10|Maid with a D8|
|11|Maid with a D10|
|12|Maid with a D12|

Penelope can only be accompanied by one maid, and to follow Penelope, she must make the same rolls as her. If Penelope has to climb some vines, her maid must also make them. If she fails, this will have consequences for both of them. If the maid rolls an exhaustion roll, she will disappear as if her die had run out. Finally, if Penelope stops for a moment and takes a break, the maid accompanying her also recovers her full die.

If you encounter a maid in the kitchens, she will be preparing food, but if you encounter her in a courtyard, you can roll on the following table to determine what she was doing.

|D6|What is she doing?|
|---|---|
|1|Pouring ouzo from a large jar|
|2|Adding wood to the fireplaces and fires|
|3|Playing a musical instrument|
|4|Cleaning the floors of food and drink remnants|
|5|Refilling oil lamps or lighting unlit torches|
|6|Serving food from a large bronze platter|

**Bribed maids** are a problem you can use at any time, especially when they disappear. The options are varied.

* Perhaps she'll generate a gossips point when she disappears.
* Perhaps she'll intentionally fail a Stealth check so your Penelope will be discovered.
* She could warn the suitor who bribed her to set a trap for our PC.

Keep in mind that if Penelope treats the bribed maid well and with respect, she might side with Penelope and not betray her.

\sp

Try to give clues when describing the bribed maid so they can try to do something about this situation.

### Gossips

It's not «normal and decent» for a queen to wander around the palace late at night, doing strange things, wandering through corridors and peristyles, and entering suitors' and servants' quarters.

People begin to discuss these nocturnal activities behind your back, and rumors about you spread throughout the palace. This gossip can be as dangerous as a kopis wound.

Because of this, the GM may decide that one of the consequences of failing a roll is that someone sees you and tells others about it. This generates 1 gossips point, and when it reaches 3, the rumors about the queen become so widespread that she has to abort her mission and return to her room, knowing that she hasn't undone her work and is closer to having to choose a future husband.

Some examples of situations that generate gossips:

* Penelope entering the suitors' chambers.
* Disposing of a corpse.
* Pushing a suitor out a window.
* Spying or sneaking behind columns.
* Tampering with someone's food or drink.
* Flirting with someone.
* Hiding a weapon or dangerous object in her clothing.

Since gossips points cannot be removed, you should always give your Penelope the opportunity to try to fix the situation in some way.

* Perhaps she can negotiate a bribe.
* Threatening him, if he's a subject.
* Offering a future favor that will also enable a future plot when they come to collect it.
* Blackmailing the witness with some secret she knows about him.
* She could seduce him.
* Or even kill him.

He usually has seconds to react, so his plan to quell the rumors can't be too complicated, and he'll only have his equipment and whatever's in the current palace room at his disposal.

He can use his **Spartan training** in these situations.

## Creating Your Penelope

To begin, on your character sheet, write down the nickname and pronouns you want your Penelope to use.

All skills are scored on D4, and you must assign a D10, a D8, and a D6 to three skills you think your character excels at.

Characters have a total of 6 skills:

* **Bash:** wreck, move, force.
* **Dash:** run, jump, climb.
* **Sneak:** hide, skulk, lurk.
* **Wander:** orient, pursue, shortcut.

\sp

* **Think:** perceive, analyze, repair.
* **Sway:** charm, manipulate, intimidate.

|D6|Initial piece of equipment|
|---|---|
|1|Kopis|
|2|Bronze shield|
|3|Ball of Wool|
|4|Small polished metal mirror|
|5|Jewelry|
|6|Poison

Every night, you'll also carry in your basket a random piece of D10 item of equipment that you've managed to sneak unnoticed and have hidden in your room.

## Every night…

Every night the suitors throw some kind of party or event.

|D6|Event|
|---|---|
|1|Quiet Night|
|2|Orgy/Bacchanal|
|3|Feast|
|4|Music concert and/or poetry festival|
|5|Wrestling matches|
|6|Deathduel|

These parties can make Penelope's mission easier in some ways and more difficult in others.

### Quiet Night

The suitors have gone to bed early, perhaps waking up early to hunt or fish. **There are no suitors awake** other than the occasional one who gets up to go to the bathroom, eat something, or sneak into someone else's room.

You'll only find maids keeping the lamps and fireplaces lit. The rest will be asleep in their chambers. 

### Orgy/Bacchanal

Everything has gotten out of hand, and in just a few minutes, a bacchanal of alcohol and sex has erupted. The guest and servants' quarters and the bathrooms are filled with suitors engaging in all sorts of sexual practices with the servants and other suitors (the chances of finding a suitor increase by one rank). Meanwhile, the rest of the rooms are empty, and only moans and muffled screams can be heard (the chances of finding a suitor decrease by one rank).

Luckily for Penelope, barring very serious matters like murder or royal fornication, the gossip will focus on the people participating in the orgy, and therefore **no gossip points can be generated**. No one will care about the queen's eccentric nocturnal activities right now.

\sp

### Feast

The suitors have raided the royal pantries and cellars and have prepared a grand feast. The kitchens and dining rooms are bustling with activity, with suitors fighting over the best dishes and liquors.

The chances of suitors being found in **kitchens, dining rooms, cellars, and pantries are high (2 additional ranks on the roll to encounter suitors)**. In these places, there will always be service with trays of food.

Getting drunk, drugging, or poisoning is fairly easy during feasts; there is a lot of food, a lot of drink, and little control.

### Music concert and/or poetry festival

As if nothing had happened, the suitors have taken out their harps, reed pipes, and syringes and put on an impromptu concert. Others have begun to sing and demand poetry. A poetry competition soon breaks out, where the winner is the one who receives the most applause.

The better part of these nights is that the music and singing are so loud that it's easy to move around without being heard, and all the **rolls where it's important not to be heard are a higher rank**.

These events usually take place in gardens and open courtyards, taking advantage of the cool night air (which raises the roll to find suitors by one rank), but they can be found anywhere; the muses can visit you anywhere.

### Wrestling matches

Fights require large areas to set up the rings, so the dining rooms and weapons rooms have been taken over by suitors.

The bathrooms too, where they are washed and oiled to make them difficult to grab in wrestling matches.

In all these rooms, the chances of finding suitors increase by a notch.

The atmosphere is buzzing with competition, and the suitors are more aggressive than usual. Meanwhile, the staff, who are already familiar with these situations, take refuge in pantries, kitchens, and their chambers, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible.

### Deathduel

All the furniture in the throne room has been cleared, and the suitors have set up a makeshift ring where two of them will duel to the death.

**Outside the throne room** there are almost no suitors, and the **chances of meeting a future husband drop by 2 die ranks**. If Penelope wants to wait until the duel is over, the winner's friends will throw a bacchanal.

> The goal of these events is to give each night a different flavor. As the DJ, you are free to deviate from these rules or create your own events.

\sp

## The palace rooms

The palace of Ithaca is immense and has thousands of rooms and halls with all kinds of uses. Penelope must navigate through them, dodging suitors until she reaches the throne room, where the loom is located where she weaves the tapestry during the day.

That's why here's a simple system so you can quickly map out the route of the rooms Penelope will navigate through to reach the throne room.

|D12|Room|
|---|---|
|1|Gardens|
|2|Kitchens|
|3|Larders|
|4|Cellars|
|5|Dining rooms|
|6|Servants' quarters|
|7|Guest quarters|
|8|Treasure Room|
|9|Stables|
|10|Bathrooms|
|11|Internal courtyards|
|12|Peristyle|

Each room comes with a description, possible problems, items you can collect, and maids you can encounter.

\sc

### Gardens

The palace gardens are large, with plenty of grass, rose bushes and shrubs, fruit trees, flower boxes, and dirt and stone paths to navigate. Fortunately, they are not lit, except on nights with a full moon.

The gardens have the advantage of surrounding the palace and **allowing access to any part of the palace from any other by passing through them**. The major disadvantage is that they are guarded by guards and their hunting dogs, and the latter are difficult to persuade, intimidate, or seduce.

Burying is possible, but only for small items like incriminating weapons or bottles of poison. Attempting to bury a corpse would take a long time, and the disturbed earth would be easily noticeable.

There aren't many items to collect, but there might always be some gardening tools and string left behind by the gardeners.

### Kitchens

Unlike other parts of the palace, the kitchens are always bustling with activity, from people who get up early to light fires and ovens and prepare bread, to those who clear away leftovers from banquets late into the night.

You can find all kinds of knives, machetes, skewers, mallets, etc., as well as cooking and burning oil, rope, cloth, and rags.

\sp

The kitchens, often serving as apothecaries and infirmaries, are the most likely places to find bandages and supplies you can use for first aid, not to mention products you can use as poison, such as poisonous mushrooms, and also food and drink that can be poisoned.

Beggars come to the kitchen windows to collect leftovers and may be able to do you a favor for a few loaves of bread and some bacon.

### Larders

The once-full palace pantries are increasingly empty due to the suitors' constant excesses. Even so, there is still food, but the small luxuries Penelope enjoyed have disappeared from the shelves and cupboards.

The good thing about pantries is that they are usually dark, closed, with no windows to the outside, and no one usually wanders around them, except on special occasions such as when new items are brought in or an inventory is taken. The bad thing is that anyone can walk in at any time and catch you red-handed.

### Cellars

Cellars are like larders, but even darker and more enclosed (the chance of finding a suitor drops by one rank). In fact, some are underground, and at most, there are small windows in the ceiling.

Usually, there's only wine and ouzo, but it's of the highest quality, and you can definitely get drunk or bribe someone with a good jug of spirits from the cellar.

They're normally locked, but of course, Penelope, as queen, should have access to them. It's probably a perfect place to "stop and breathe" and get rid of all the accumulated exhaustion.

### Dining rooms

The dining rooms are among the largest rooms in the palace. They are filled with long tables with benches and usually have several entrances from which guests or staff enter with food and libations.

Knives, plates, and metal trays can be found here, as well as food and drinks, tablecloths, napkins, etc., as well as good steaks and beef bones to throw to the dogs guarding the palace.

They are the main gathering place for the suitors, and usually all the parties and fights start at their tables. It's also not surprising that the household pets prowl around under the tables.

### Servants' quarters

They are usually either large communal rooms where several maids sleep, separated by curtains, or small private rooms for higher-ranking maids. In both cases, there aren't many things you can use, just the servants' simple personal belongings and little else.

\sp

A hard day's work means those in these rooms sleep soundly, and if they are awakened by any noise, they believe it's a colleague who has gone to the bathroom or gotten up early to do their chores.

### Guest quarters

These chambers have been taken over by the suitors and are the most chaotic element of the palace. They come in many shapes and sizes and can be spotless to the point of being pigpens with garbage and leftover food and drink everywhere.

Apart from a bed, a desk, and a wardrobe, there may be anything. This depends on the suitor and their profession and hobbies.

|D6|Suitor|
|---|---|
|1|**Scholar:** Papyrus and writing materials, chemicals, and measuring tools|
|2|**Artist:** Painting materials, sculpting tools, papyrus and paints|
|3|**Athlete:** Sports equipment such as discus or javelins, weights, and body oils|
|4|**Musician/Poet:** Musical instruments of all kinds, ink and parchment, and flamboyant robes|
|5|**Partygoer:** Alcoholic beverages, fetish equipment, and oils and essences|
|6|**Warrior:** Weapons, armor, helmets and shields|

### Treasure Room

This room contains years of history for the royal family. It's a kind of museum where ancestral weapons and armor, war spoils, trophies, awards, and more are kept.

The various objects are displayed in niches, on shelves, hangers, and pedestals. The walls are covered with rich tapestries depicting the royal family's great deeds.

In this room, you can find very interesting items such as **weapons and armor of all kinds**, but keep in mind that **you won't be able to break them**, as their absence would be noticeable, and you'd have to return them at the end of the night. Any item taken here should not be lower than a D6, or it will be obvious it's been used.

The room is usually **locked and guarded** because of the riches it contains. Because of this, the die for finding a suitor is lowered by one rank. So, entering and passing through it won't be easy.

### Stables

Despite what you might think, the royal stables don't just house horses; there are also cows, pigs, and sheep.

\sp

It's full of farm implements such as forks for feeding the animals, **sickles and scythes for cutting crops, shovels, ropes, and nets**.

You can also find a small workshop with tools for making and repairing farm implements, such as saddles, tack, oxen yokes, etc.

At night, there isn't much human activity, so the die for finding a suitor drops one rank, but there is animal activity. If you're not stealthy, the horses will start neighing, the cows will moo, the sheep will bleat, and so on. And it can cause quite a commotion, which will attract people.

### Bathrooms

From simple latrines to majestic hot springs with hot and cold tubs, massage tables, and benches where you can rest and chat with others. Soap, body oils, and towels are useful items you can find.

The baths can offer a **place to treat injuries yourself**. It's a clean place, with cloths you can use as bandages and water to clean wounds. You can also fill the baths with steam using the hot spring waters, which will allow you to sneak away unseen.

In the baths, as in the kitchens, there are different **compounds that could be used as poisons or drugs** to stupefy or put a person to sleep.

### Internal courtyards

They are the heart of every Greek mansion and palace. It's impossible to move around the palace without passing through them. In these courtyards, you can find fountains, giant flowerpots, fruit trees, and tall hedges, which provide good hiding places. While it's common to encounter people passing by, there may also be some strollers taking advantage of the cool evening air.

Since most of the palace's rooms overlook interior courtyards, they are not far from prying eyes, and usually **everything that happens in them is known to everyone** unless you're very careful.

Since there's enough soil in the gardens to **bury small things** that you could recover in the future.

### Peristyle

The Peristyle is the gallery of columns that surrounds a building. They're more decorative than rooms to stay in, but they're perfect because no one is ever around and the columns provide good cover.

However, it shouldn't be unusual to find two passionate lovers hiding behind the columns or a group of conspirators hiding from the rest of the suitors.

\sp

> All of the above rooms are just examples, but feel free to create your own rooms, such as a gymnasium, an audience chamber, an armory, etc.

### The Throne Room

The throne room is the most impressive room you can enter, home to the throne of the missing king and queen Penelope. This room is unique; there is no other like it in the entire palace. Here is the loom where Penelope weaves every day.

As you already know, the goal is to reach this loom and undo the work you've done during the day, while preventing the suitors from forcing you to choose one of them.

When you see fit, Penelope will enter the throne room to complete her mission. But she will need to **clear the throne room of suitors** to unweave the tapestry.

Some events leave the throne room almost empty, but others fill it with people. Penelope must overcome this final challenge to return to her chambers.

## The suitors

The suitors are the main antagonist of this game. They swarm throughout the palace day and night, doing everything from shooting their bows to composing epic poems to throwing the Olympic discus.

Normally, to determine if the room where Penelope enters has suitors, you can **roll a D6 and look at the following table**. Remember that we've already seen that there are situations and events that modify this check, and there are rooms where there shouldn't be suitors (unless you, as the GM, want them to).

|D6|Suitor|
|---|---|
|1-3|There are no suitors|
|4+|There are suitors|

Suitors are a unique unit, and their number doesn't matter. Whether there's one suitor or a dozen at the game level, they're simply a complication. The number only matters when figuring out how to resolve the complication. Perhaps Penelope tries to knock out or seduce a suitor, but has to intimidate or evade a large group of suitors.

Taking out suitors could be a good consequence to use in quests. If Penelope falls from the roof into the inner courtyard while trying to reach the throne room, a couple of suitors may appear, having heard the noises on the roof and gone out into the inner courtyard to see what's happening. Penelope will have to hide, run away, or try to convince them that she also heard something strange while pretending that her leg hurts from the fall and that her tunic is torn.

\sp

The suitors are the main enemy, but not the only one. Many other things can happen during the night, such as enemies of Ithaca entering and trying to kill Penelope, or drunken suitors starting a fire, and they have to flee the palace or rescue servants and/or royal treasures.

[Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope#Pretendientes_de_Pen%C3%A9lope) has a list of suitors in case you need names.

## Secondary plots

The main plot of Ithaca is reaching the loom to undone your diary work, but you can include secondary plots or subplots in your nocturnal adventures.

* A suitor has «overstepped» the rules of hospitality with one of your maids and may be found dead in her bed, or perhaps he has a horse-riding accident because his saddle girths «broke» while he was galloping.
* A suitor has taken a young maiden to his chamber. It would be good to make sure nothing bad happens to her or take the necessary measures.
* You have detected a strong rivalry between several suitors. Perhaps you can do something like leave a valuable item from one suitor in the other's chamber or get the maids to give them drinks until they get drunk enough to fight.

\sc

* The suitors have found the secret palace wine cellar, and you want to rescue some bottles you were saving from your wedding day before they drink them.
* You've been telling them that the palace is haunted by the ghost of your husband, and you're going to try to convince them that strange things happen at night so that the more cowardly suitors will leave.
* You've undone all the work you've done during the day, and upon returning to your chambers, you hear a scream. Perhaps you should go and find out what happened.
* The plots are designed to be played at night, but it can be a fun change of pace to do it during the day with all the palace activity in full swing, but where many of your actions aren't seen as strange.

## Epílogue

\conc

While creating this game, I had some ideas and thoughts that I'd like to express here.

* The game is based on a classical myth and deals with heterosexual relationships. Feel completely free to turn the whole game into a Sapphic or Aquileian adventure. In fact, the use of pronouns in character creation not only respects the wishes of the system's creator, but also allows you to create the sexual-affective and gender relationships that best fit your table.
* While creating this game, someone pointed out to me that many of the situations that would arise in this game are common ones that women experience every day. As a man, I hope that when you master or play this game, you will be respectful of this topic and that you reflect, even if only for a few minutes, on these issues.
* I wanted to highlight a secondary character who is a classic example of patience, fidelity, and a devoted wife, and make her a central character in her own story, deciding her destiny and fighting to make it happen. In fact, throughout the game, I've avoided using the name of Penelope's stranded husband so as not to diminish Penelope's importance.
* As always, I may have made mistakes in how I approached the above points, and I'm happy to receive constructive criticism and make any necessary changes.
