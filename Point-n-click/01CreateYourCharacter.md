The first thing you need to do to start playing this role-playing game is to create a character for each player. The process is simple; you just need to make a few decisions and write them down on your character sheet.

### 1. Step - Defining Your Adventure Game

The first thing is to choose which Adventure Game (AG) your character comes from. The AG where your character was originated determines their abilities. Being a character from «The Dig» is not the same as being one from «Maniac Mansion».

When defining which AG your character come from, the first step is to give your AG a title and **choose the video resolution** in which it was developed. Your resolution determines the initial pixels of your character. Your pixel count is important because it allows you to do special things within the GA.

It also determines the size of your equipment area. With low resolution, you have a lot of space because it's mostly text lists, while with high resolution, it's mostly complex pixelated images.

* **CGA:** 320x200 and 4 colors, **4 píxels** and **10 spaces**
* **EGA:** 320×200 and 16 colors, **8 píxels** and **8 spaces**
* **VGA:** 640x480 and 256 colors, **10 píxels** and **4 spaces**

Next, choose your theme, **choosing 2 topics**:

* **Science Fiction:** Adventures with futuristic or non-futuristic science fiction themes. **+2 pixels**
* **Franchise:** Stories based on famous movies and book series. **+2 spaces**
* **Fantasy:** Magical fairytale worlds inhabited by elves, dwarves, and other magical beings. **+2 spaces**
* **Horror:** Scary and horrific stories featuring haunted houses, cursed towns, creatures frozen in ice, etc. **+1 pixel and +1 space**
* **Comedy:** Wacky, cartoon-like stories, usually with eccentric characters or anthropomorphic animals. **+2 pixels**
* **Mystery:** From Victorian detectives to modern police cases, including hard-boiled detectives. **+2 pixels**
* **Pulp:** Pulp stories with heroes and heroines searching for lost civilizations, traveling by seaplanes, and almost always fighting Nazis. **+1 pixel and +1 space**
* **Spicy:** Stories that are very close to humor, but with spicy and lustful touches. **+1 pixel and +1 space**

Finally, **choose the developer**:

* **LucasArts Games:** The developer of classic AG that everyone remembers. **+2 pixels**

* **Sierra:** The distinguished competition. **+2 spaces**
* **Alcachofa Soft:** The geniuses of wacky humor. **+1 pixel and +1 space**
* **Revolution Software:** A hidden gem that has produced some of the genre's greatest treasures. **+2 pixels**
* **Coktel studios:** The geeks who were looking for alternative approaches to a very static format. **+1 pixel and +1 space**
* **Pendulo Studios:** They've tried to bring the genre back to its former glory without much success, but without losing hope and their touch. **+2 spaces**
* **Deconstructeam!:** You're a modern indie gamer who enjoys retropixels. **+2 pixels**

The next step is to **calculate the equipment space and pixels**. Remember that if the pixels or spaces are odd, convert one pixel to a space, or vice versa.

### 2. Step - Create your interface

Every character in an AG has some basic verbs:

* Walk to
* Pick up
* Give
* Talk to
* Look
* Use

Then you must **choose 3 more verbs** from this list:

* Open/Close

* Search
* Run
* Turn on/Off
* Hit
* Read
* Pull/Push

### 3. Step - Finishing Touches

As finishing touches, you must **define your name**, something that fits your AG and its theme, and **choose your pronouns**.

Finally, you must **choose a starting piece of equipment** by rolling on the following table:

|d6|Science Fiction, Fantasy, Pulp|Mystery, Horror, Franchise|Humor, Spicy|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Shovel|Rusty Pruning Shears|Rubber Chicken|
|2|Grog Jug|Broken Magnifying Glass|Helium Balloon|
|3|Spurs|Fake Passport|Stress Ball|
|4|Tranquilizer Dart Gun|Metronome|Mousetrap|
|5|Cardboard 3D Glasses|Carnival Mask|Ball of Twine|
|6|Flashlight|Whistle|Trumpet|
