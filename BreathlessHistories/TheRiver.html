        <h1>Down to the river, a Breathless story <a href="https://gwannon.com/">by Gwannon</a></h1>
<p>The days are longer and the nights are shorter, which is a good thing, since the horrors mostly attack at night.</p>
<p>The fresh breeze of the river reminds you of when you used to enjoy air conditioning in your homes and workplaces.</p>
<p>On your last adventure, you acquired a river barge and have been traveling around on it. You can sleep on it, it's easy to defend, and it can carry you and your gear.</p>
<p>You're approaching a new part of the river. Hopefully, there will be few crawlers and hopefully plenty to loot, because supplies are running out.</p>
<h2>The barge</h2>
<p>Your old barge is rusty and old, but its operation is very basic, making maintenance very simple. A very simple combustion engine and a mechanical helm. No computers, no electricity, just gasoline and patching the hull.</p>
<p>The barge can carry about 20 people, with their equipment and belongings.</p>
<p>The cargo space below deck has been divided with panels and cloths into cubicles where each survivor sleeps. It's not very private, but it's a luxury in this world.</p>
<p>In the center, there's a free area where everyone shelters during bad weather. If the weather is good, everyone moves to the upper deck.</p>
<p>Defensively, the river acts like a castle moat, and boarding axes and machetes are scattered throughout the deck to repel attacks and cut ropes that could be used during boardings.</p>
<p>If the enemies have firearms, you can cover under deck or behind the bulwarks.</p>
<p>The helm is in a small cabin in the stern of the barge, and you have an inflatable boat to disembark. </p>
<h2>The docks</h2>
<p>The dock seems deserted, but it's never true. It's easy to spot your barge arriving, and it's not the first time someone has tried to «welcome» you when you disembark at the piers. That's when you're most vulnerable.</p>
<p>So you've gotten into the habit of disembarking a group half a kilometer before the docking point to look for potential trouble.</p>
<p>If everything is OK, you wave up from the dock and the barge disembarks.</p>
<h3>Riparians</h3>
<p>Interestingly, you are the ones who will explore the riverbank this time before the barge docks.</p>
<p>It's not easy to be a riparian, you risk your life and, if something goes bad, the barge doesn't try to save you. It will wait a day in the middle of the river and if you don't appear, it will depart without you.</p>
<p>If you run into trouble, you'll have to find a way to reach the barge while dodging crawlers and river pirates. It's hard, but the survival in this world is it.</p>
<h3>Along the riverbank</h3>
<p>As soon as you disembark and the inflatable boat moves away, the problems begin.</p>

<h3>Problems at the docks</h3>
<p>Once you reach the docks, it's time to explore to know if the place is safe. If it is, you can wave up the barge to dock.</p>
<p>If there are troubles, you'll have to overcome them (crawlers, bandits, toxic waste, etc.) or dodge them and look for a vessel to reach the barge.</p>

<p>It's getting dark, and whether the barge docks or stays in the middle of the river, you'll have to pass the night here.</p>
<h2>The light</h2>
<p>When night falls, you see something you haven't seen in years: electric light. The side of the rooftop facing your side of the river on one of the city's buildings is completely illuminated.</p>
<p>You don't know can be this electric light, but it can be interesting to investigate it. If there are more people, they might join the community. If there's some kind of generator working, that would be a good find.</p>
<p>It can be a trap; but no one would waste precious electricity to attract people to rob and kill them.</p>
<p>As riparians, it's your duty to investigate the lights. The plan is simple: as the barge navigates the meander, you'll cross the city, exploring the illuminated building, and be picked up on the other side of the bend in the river.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>They estimate it will take them all morning to reach the other side of the bend. They'll wait for you there until the next morning, and if you haven't reached it, they'll go away without you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One day is enough time to complete the mission</strong>, but if you want to pressure your survivors, pretend to keep track of the hours each time they catch the breath. It's important that they think there's a time limit.</p>

<h3>Walk to the skyscraper</h3>
<p>There are many ways to reach the skyscraper, and each one has its pros and cons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main streets.</strong> It's the fastest route, but it's also the most risky road.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary streets.</strong> It can be the option with the best time/security ratio, but you can lose and time is important.</li>
<li><strong>Sewer system and underground tunnels.</strong> There may be crawlers and certainly lots of rats, but don't expect anything else, and the route is very fast.</li>
<li><strong>Elevated trains.</strong> Following the train tracks wouldn't be a bad option, if it weren't for the fact that it leaves you with no options. You can only go forward or backward, and setting you a trap is very easy.</li>

<p><strong>Adventure seed:</strong> There's a trapper who sets traps in the city using crawlers. You should investigate because it can be a problem in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Going up</h3>
<p>As you arrive to the building, you see the logos of a megacorporation called BrainTech, and viewing the signs on the facade, it appears they were dedicated to medicine and cybernetics. It seems their headquarters were on the upper floors.</p>
<p>The large glass doors are broken and the main hall has been looted, but you never know.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>The building is divided in 4 zones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main hall:</strong> Security and access control for the rest of the building. In addition, there are a food court, newsstands, gift shops, fashion boutiques, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Lower floors</strong> Offices and spare zones for employees.</li>
<li><strong>Middle floors</strong> Laboratories and dinning rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Upper floors:</strong> Super-luxury apartments for company executives.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each zone you can rest and loot. The things that you loot must be adequate to the characteristics of the zone.</p>
<p>The only way to get to the roof is by stairs. The elevators in the main hall are broken. They must have had some kind of accident, and the elevator shaft is inaccessible.</p>

Viewing the maps and guidebooks over the table, it seems the owners were away for several weeks camping in different national parks.

<td>A <strong>security door</strong> is blocking your way; the lock looks complicated and could take a lot of lockpicking. Destroying the door would make a lot of noise and could bring crawlers.</td>

<h3>The roof</h3>
<p>The rooftop is a single room that occupies two floors and the entire floor of the building. Large windows cover the entire room, and only one side is uncovered by curtains that block out light.</p>
<p>In the center of the large room, from floor to ceiling, there is a tower that looks like a huge supercomputer, with LED lights, cables and switches. Thick cables extend from the tower and end up plugged-in the heads of six crawlers.</p>
<p>The glass in the windows through which light was coming out is broken by the impact of a flying drone that landed in the middle of the room, surrounded by shards of glass.</p>
<p>It looks like some kind of military drone with one of its rockets still unlaunched. It doesn't look badly damaged, but it's too big to carry. If its battery has power, you might be able to turn it on and control it. It's unclear whether the drone is part of an attack or part of the building's defenses.</p>
<p>When you enter the room, the crawlers activate, spot you and launch to the attack. Meanwhile, all the lights on the electronic tower begin to glow brightly.</p>
<p>Sparks and electric arcs fly from the hands of the crawlers. Their punches are like being shocked by a taser.</p>
<p>If you cut the plugged-in cables, the crawlers will no longer be controlled by the supercomputer and will no longer give electric shocks with every attack, but they will still be aggressive and will attack you.</p>
</div><div class="saltopagina"></div><div class='columns'>
<p>If you defeat the crawlers, a pixelated face will appear on a LED screen, and it begins to shout out.</p>
<pre><code>- I need my bodies. I will die without my bodies. You have sentenced me to disappear!!!</code></pre>
<p>All the electronic structure will begin to overheat and smoke. You better get out of the building quickly.</p>
<p>Once you're outside the building, you see that the roof is on fire. Suddenly, the drone flies off with difficulty, unless it has been destroyed or looted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Adventure seed:</strong> Now an angry, crazy AI that controls a military drone with an unlaunched missile chases your survivors all over the city.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Return to the river</h2>
<p>You don't always win, and this time you haven't gained anything valuable from your incursion, but you're still alive, and that's a lot in this world.</p>
<p>This part of the adventure is essentially the same as the stretch from the riverbank to the BrainTech building. The routes are the same (main streets, side streets, etc.), and the complications can be the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the GM, in this part you can play with the time limit to pressure them and force them to take the fastest and least safe paths.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>River pirates</h3>
<p>As you approach the meeting point, you see another barge rounding the meander and speeding up, likely to ram your vessel.</p>
<p>Their vessel carries a harpoon-shaped naval ram and, if they stick it in your barge, it will be impossible to separate and escape the river up or down.</p>
<p>You have to act quickly, or your friends will be killed by the pirates. Your advantage is that no one knows you're there; the pirates are too focused on their target to detect you.</p>
<p>You can try to <strong>collapse one of the giant cranes at the port</strong> over the pirate ship.</p>
<p>There are <strong>large waste deposits</strong> on the riverbank; perhaps you could empty them into the water and slow the pirates' advance. With a bit of luck, it might be something flammable and/or toxic.</p>
<p>You can <strong>get a boat and crash it against their naval ram</strong>. You wouldn't stop their advance, but you would disable their main weapon.</p>
<p>Perhaps a <strong>column of cargo containers could be collapse over the water</strong>, forcing the pirate barge to dodge them and lose speed and precious time.</p>
<p>What if you ran a <strong>steel cable to the other side</strong> so the pirates would get caught in it? Or they tied it to the dock and wrapped it around the enemy barge like an AT-AT.</p>
<p>If you had time to loot the <strong>drone missile</strong>, you might be able to program it and launch it at the river pirates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about huge items that might be in a port/shipyard and let them use them against the pirates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you stop the attack, you can reunite with your group and tell them about your adventure. Your history will be told for years around the fire bin you use to warm yourselves on cold nights.</p>
<p>If the pirates take the barge, you'll have to flee as fast as possible. You'll have to start over and find a new community of survivors.</p>
