## You open your eyes and everything is dark…

&nbsp;

It seems like you are inside your sarcophagus, but when you try to get up, you crash into an invisible wall.

You hit it with all your might, and it shatters like shards of salt. You get up as best you can, and your vision begins to adjust to the darkness. You look around in amazement.

You do not know where you are, but it is clear this is not the promised afterlife.

### Why have you woken up?

You do not know it, but someone at the museum has been playing with a cursed object from the museum’s collection, The Book of Life and Death.

They have been reading passages with powerful spells, and here you are, awakening from death 3,000 years after dying and being mummified.

### You are not alone

Luckily, you are not alone. Other mummies in the museum have risen with you, and if you organize yourselves, you can escape this horrible place you are imprisoned in.

And although it is not your world, you were pharaohs, priestesses, counselors, etc., and you still have the resources and skills necessary to escape from the hell you are in just now.
