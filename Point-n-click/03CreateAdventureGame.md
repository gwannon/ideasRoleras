## Create a Point and Click Adventure Game

&nbsp;

\conc

### Adventure duration

To begin creating your AG, you must decide its duration. The duration of an adventure is measured in floppy disks, and each disk represents one game session.

> End your sessions by saying something funny like, «Insert disk number 2».

#### 1 5.25" Floppy Disk

Due to the limited capacity of computers, 5.25" floppy disk adventures were short, with one scene per part and a maximum of two screens per scene. Perfect for an afternoon in front of your computer.

#### 1 3.5" Floppy Disk

Computers were now more powerful, allowing for longer storylines. These adventures were more complex and could take several sessions. Each part could have two or more scenes, and each scene could have multiple screens.

#### Several 3.5" Floppy Disks

We're now talking about many hours of gameplay, which can usually involve several AG played consecutively with the same theme and recurring characters/villains. We're talking about series like «KingQuest» or «Monkey Island».

### First Steps

Once the duration is decided, you need to proceed as when creating a character: choose their resolution, two topics, and select their developer. Resolution:

* **CGA:** The low resolution and lack of color in these adventures make it difficult to interact with on-screen elements. All possible rolls have a -1 penalty. Fortunately, players can place pixels (at the GM's discretion) to transform one object or clickable element into another, provided they are very similar. For example, they could transform a candle into a lit stick of dynamite. Also, with so few colors, forget about creating color-based puzzles.
* **EGA:** AGs in EGA have an acceptable and normal amount of color and resolution and neither add to nor detract from the adventures.
* **VGA:** The higher resolution of VGA means that more extra pixels must be used than usual, because everything has more pixels, so every pixel expenditure costs one extra pixel. The resolution also causes Find the single pixels rolls to have an extra penalty of -1.

\sp

Choose two topics:

* **Science Fiction:** Science fiction is very broad and allows for a wide variety of topics, from adventures on alien planets to time travel or cloning. When setting up the adventure, you will need to establish a technological level and specify which technologies are available and which are not. There might be clones and psychic powers, but no space travel or robots.
* **Franchise:** The adventure must feature the franchise's flagship hero or heroine, so one of your players cannot create their own character; they must be that iconic character, and you will provide them with a pre-made character.
* **Fantasy:** Fantasy, and especially medieval fantasy, is a recurring theme, always closer to classic fairy tales with trolls under bridges and princesses and princes than to the D&D/Tolkien fantasy more typical of other role-playing games. The other option is entirely different magical worlds, like in the classic «Loom». In these GAs, your characters' verbs can be considered spells and do not need to be next to the clickable element, only on the same screen.
* **Horror:** These adventures should be highly deadly, and it can be very interesting to set up some kind of timer or clock to put pressure on the players. They have a certain number of attempts to finish a scene, and if they fail, the monster will end their lives.
* **Humor:** Humorous adventures can't be deadly; it doesn't fit the tone. Dying and becoming a ghost, however, can be a funny scene.
* **Mystery:** Perhaps a Sherlock Holmes story shouldn't be deadly, but something darker certainly should be.
* **Pulp:** As they say, everything is better with a pulp , from science fiction to racy stories. If you take «Pulp» and «Franchise», like Conan, Zorro, or Indiana Jones, you can choose a third theme that better defines the adventure.
* **Spicy:** Spicy adventures always work well with humor—let's not forget «Leisure Suit Larry »—but they can also work with «pulp». Remember to discuss this option with your players.

Choose the developer:

* **LucasArts Games:** Humor is LucasArts' hallmark, what they're known for, but they've actually explored every genre. Even if you're not making a humorous adventure, you should include a joke, a funny line, and a parodic character. Importantly, in these adventures, **death doesn't exist**.
* **Sierra:** This distinguished competitor clearly wasn't going to exploit LucasArts' brand, so **humor is forbidden** at this developer. It's important that the adventure is called «WhateverQuest», think of «KingQuest», «SpaceQuest», or «PoliceQuest». Sierra's adventures **are always deadly**.
* **Alcachofa Soft:** Humor is your thing, so at least **one of the topics must be humorous**.

\sp

* **Revolution Software:** Its creators wanted to create a middle ground between LucasArts and Sierra games, with games that didn't take themselves too seriously, but with serious stories. The «Broken Sword» series was their biggest success, and this makes **mystery a very typical element** in their work.
* **Coktel Studios:** This French developer was a subsidiary of Sierra, but instead of being absorbed, it always maintained its distinct style with series like Goblins. They tried numerous variations of «point-and-click» games with varying degrees of success. Try to include some different and groundbreaking mechanic in your AGs, something that changes the interface, the use of pixels, etc.
* **Pendulo Studios:** Your screens are small mini-puzzles woven into a story. That's why there should be a higher proportion of puzzles than conversations or interactions with on-screen elements. **You only develop in VGA**, and the characters should also be in VGA, but it's not mandatory.
* **Deconstructeam!:** You're a modern developer; CGA and EGA aren't your thing. Like Pendulo, you only develop in VGA.

With this information, you should create the game synopsis, which will be written on the back of the game board box. This couple of paragraphs will be the introduction with which you should begin the game.

Once you've chosen everything above, you must decide **whether the adventure will be deadly or not**. That's one of the major differences between game boards.

#### Deadly Adventures

These adventures will feature certain situations defined as deadly. From a sword fight with a medieval knight to crossing a room filled with deadly lasers.

If the players attempt these actions, they should be able to roll to succeed. If they fail, they simply die. There are no hit points or wounds involved.

You should warn them that what they want to do is very dangerous before they roll the dice.

You should also have set up items and actions that grant bonuses to their rolls, such as putting a wrench in their boxing gloves or crossing a corridor when the skull's red eyes flicker because the mechanism that launches poison darts from the walls is reactivating.

#### Non-Deadly Adventures

In these adventures, they simply won't be able to attempt the dangerous action they want to do, and it will often mean they're missing something to solve the challenge.

Imagine there's a river of lava, and a rope has been placed across it. If they try to cross the river balancing on the rope, the character will turn around, look at the screen, and say something funny like, «Are you stupid?» or «My mother didn't raise a fool».

\sp

They'll probably be missing something, and they'll have to go back to using a mop, take off the mop head, and use it as a pole to cross the river like a tightrope walker. And don't be surprised if later you use the mop head as a wig for a disguise.

> Humorous adventures shouldn't be deadly, but it's your game, your rules.

#### You're dead…

When a **character dies**, they simply **disappear**, explode, fall down a bottomless pit, are disintegrated, etc., and **reappear once the scene is resolved** with all their equipment, but without pixels.

If all the players die, then it's more serious, and both will reappear at the beginning of the scene and have to do it again. They will have lost all the progress they made in that scene, and on top of that, they're all **without pixels**.

### Main Structure

Action Game Players (AGs), like all stories, are typically divided into three parts: introduction, rising action, and resolution. Each part is further divided into several scenes, each with its own challenges and puzzles to solve.

The scenes within each part can be sequential, occur in parallel, or even be a mix of both.

For example, a sequential scene might involve obtaining the map that reveals the location of the king's lost tomb, overcoming the tomb's traps, and finally deciphering the symbols on the king's medallion to open the portal that allows you to advance to the second part.

A parallel scene might involve simultaneously investigating three clues found at the murder scene to identify the killer.

### Scenes and Screens

Each scene will have one or more challenges and one or more screens. Creating a scene is as simple as defining what will happen in that scene and writing a couple of paragraphs describing what should happen. From there, you need to define the elements of that scene: screens, NPCs, and clickable elements, and how they relate to each other.

The easiest way to record all of this is to create a diagram of the screens with their clickable elements and the NPCs on them. You should also note how the screens connect, which connections can be used, and which connections are closed and need to be opened.

The adventure «The Enigma of the Monkey Peninsula» shows you how to create this diagram.

#### Challenges, Riddles, and Mini-Puzzles

By challenges, we mean a combination of actions, clickable elements, and NPCs to solve a problem. We must define what we will need and how to obtain it; perhaps it's simply talking to someone specific, like the third passenger on the bus.

\sp

They can also be more complex options: take the ketchup packet from the table, give it to diner 1, who will thank you by giving you their mashed potatoes, and clog the toilet with the mashed potatoes so that the restaurant's cook has to leave the kitchen to fix it, allowing you to enter the kitchen.

When examining clickable elements, they should have clues about how to use those objects, for example, with phrases like, «This mashed potato is so thick it could be cement». Talking to NPCs should also provide clues, such as, «I'm never coming back to this restaurant. The food is bland, and this is the worst mashed potato I've ever had». Perhaps placing a plunger near the cook is another clue, and when examining it, mentioning that it's very worn and has many hamburger grease stains.

To create riddles or mini-puzzles, you can draw inspiration from anything; you just need to adapt it to the AG's setting. If you want to include a sliding puzzle, it will have an Aztec image; if it's a pulp story, a 1920s theme; or circuits if it's a cyberpunk story.

You can find many riddles online, and like puzzles, simply adapting them to the setting is all it takes.

### Passage of Time

Time does not pass in AGs. If a scene takes place at night, whatever they do during the scene will always be night, even if they wait for hours in the same place, it will still be night.

Time only advances (if you want it to) at the end of each scene. You have an entire night to discover who killed the commissioner, and when you do, day breaks and you launch into a frantic race to capture his killer, who is trying to flee to Mexico.

Just as the players can force a «meanwhile» moment with pixels, the GM can force flashbacks to give the players information; some scenes can even be flashbacks where they play with their past selves.

> Using information across time isn't «metagaming». You can use what you know about the adventure whenever you want, regardless of how many time shifts occur.

### Railroad Adventures

Game-set adventures are classic examples of railroad adventures; there's only one path and one way to progress, and any other approach won't work.

However, this isn't fun in a role-playing game. But unlike a video game, as a GM, you can overcome this. Your decisions aren't fixed in the code; instead, you can modify the story and accept other options.

So, if the players propose a viable option that solves the challenges, let them use it even if it's not the solution you had in mind.

\sp

### Final Touches

Finally, if you haven't already, add a cool mechanic that sets your adventure apart from the rest. Let's look at some classic examples:

* In «Loom», they aren't verbs, they're combinations of musical notes, and if you play them backward, they do the opposite. If Do Re Mi opens things, Mi Re Do closes them.
* The «Monkey Island» games have their insult duels where you must learn sharp insults and their comebacks to defeat your enemies in sword fights.
* «The Dig» had its colored rod puzzles with different polyhedra. You had to find the right combination from different clues you saw throughout the adventure.
