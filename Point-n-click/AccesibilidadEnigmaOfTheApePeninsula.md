# The enigma of the Ape Peninsula
> Version 1.0 | December 2025
_Deep in the Caribbean lies a peninsula surrounded by water on all sides, called the Ape Peninsula. Venture into its dark grottoes, dense jungles, and well-stocked gift and souvenir shops to become a true buccaneer._

_You'll have to face zombie ships, vampire pirate captains, talking shrunken heads, and plenty of apes, using your intelligence, your wit, and the powerful, sometimes explosive, magic of voodoo._

_If you're lucky enough to avoid scurvy, you might just survive this adventure and find the greatest pirate treasure ever known, Mac’n Cheese, earning the respect of the entire Caribbean._## The enigma of the Ape Peninsula

«The enigma of the Ape Peninsula» is a graphic adventure game for EGA, available on three 3.5-inch floppy disks. Its theme is humor and fantasy, and it was developed by LucasArts Games. To play this adventure, you only need the [Basic Rules for «Point and Click RPG»](https://pointnclick.gwannon.com/).

The first part of this adventure (Disk 1) is the introductory adventure included in the basic rules, so if you've already played it, you can skip it.

### Special rules

#### Look behind you… A three-tailed ape!

Once per game session, one of your players can spend 2 pixels and use the "Look behind you… A three-tailed ape!" trick. After saying the phrase, the player must roll a d6.

On a roll of 6, the other target turns around to face the three-tailed ape, and all players can perform an action, such as picking up something the target was holding, fleeing, or going through a door.

This trick only works with NPCs you can talk to, and it always fails when there is actually a three-tailed ape behind you.

Your PCs have just arrived in Bucan Ville, a pirate haven, with the intention of becoming pirates themselves and making a fortune through piracy.

This part is divided into four scenes. The first will be a brief introduction. Then there will be two parallel scenes: one in which the _**Pirate Lady Bosses**_ grant them the _**pirate degree**_ after they pass a test, and another in which they acquire a ship and its flag. The fourth scene will be the heist of the governor's safe.

### 1. The beginning

The PJs appear at nightfall in the harbour of Bucan Ville and will shout «My name is [PJ name] and I want to be a pirate».

#### Harbour

In this filthy, seedy harbour, there's only one place to go: the _**Boiled Crab Tavern**_, a pirate's den where the grog is watered down and the snacks and peanuts were once Blackbeard's cabin boys.

In the distance, a _**ship with tattered black sails**_ can be seen. An eerie glow floods its deck, and flocks of bats circle overhead.

From the port, you can access _**Bucan Ville Town Center**_.
[![18:57 (Rework) By Fatbeard91](./images/dkctb16-e97df894-f777-41ea-a026-ae54e3488aa4.jpg "18:57 (Rework) By Fatbeard91")](https://www.deviantart.com/fatbeard91/art/18-57-Rework-1230846234 "18:57 (Rework) By Fatbeard91")
#### Boiled Crab Tavern

The place is a dingy old dive, packed with _**drunken pirates. The few who aren't sleeping off their hangovers can barely manage a sentence:

* So you want to be a pirate, huh? Talk to the three _**Pirate Ladybosses**_.
* The grog in my day was real grog, not like the stuff they make now with little umbrellas, cloves, and mint leaves. We used to put real cloves in it.
* Have you heard of [Ahoy! Cthulhu](https://arrrcthulhu.com/)? It's an excellent setting for pirate adventures in a Caribbean of the Cthulhu Mythos.
* They stole my idea for the monkey-traffic light. I could have been a millionaire and retired to a Caribbean island and spent my days drinking grog. Oops, I already do that.

At a large table in the back sit the _**3 Pirate Ladybosses**_. The most powerful pirates of Bucan Ville, chosen by the democratic method of slaughtering all their competition.

These three rude pirates are at the table, drinking grog and singing bawdy songs. When your players explain that they want to be pirates, they'll laugh a lot and tell them to stop wasting their time and go back to what they were doing.

Your players will have to prove they really want to be pirates by answering questions like these:

* What was Stede Bonnet's nickname? - Gentleman pirate
* What was Blackbeard's flag? - A horned skeleton holding an hourglass in its right hand and a spear in its left, using the spear to pierce a red heart that drips three drops of red blood.
* What was the name of Blackbeard's first ship? - Queen Anne's Revenge.

They'll also make them sing "Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum" (which your players will have to sing). After a while trying to prove they deserve a test, they agree to take the standardized pirate guild exam, which consists of two tests:

* You must prove you're on the other side of the law.
* You must own your own self-propelled ship and create your own unique, personalized pirate flag.

After explaining the standardized tests, they will be asked to sign some paperwork and given a _**discount voucher**_ for the _**Souvenir Shop**_. If they ask for any hints, they will simply be told to ask for _**Sam**_ at the shipyard to see what they can offer in terms of ships.

On the table of the  _**three Pirate Ladybosses**_, there is a _**fruit bowl**_ with oranges, bananas, apples, Swiss vitamin C candies, and lemons, which they claim are from their scurvy eradication campaign.

If they ask, they can take _**a piece of fruit**_. Choose one at random and give it to them. If they eat it, they can ask for another. Until they finish the other piece of fruit they took, the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ will tell them to finish it first.
### 2.a Cross over to the other side of the law

As the Pirate lady Bosses explained, to become a pirate, you need to be on the other side of the law and have proof of it.

There are several ways to commit crimes:

* The easiest way is to run the red light at the monkey traffic light in _**Bucan Ville's Main Square**_.
* Another way is to stand to the left of the _**courthouse**_ while the _**painter**_ in the _**Main Square**_ is painting.
* If you try other kind of crimes, your characters will look at the screen and say things like, «My mother didn't raise a petty thief» or «This would put me on Santa's naughty list.»

If you see them getting lost at this point, emphasize the "other side of the law" part or remind them of the drunken pirate in the Boiled Crab Tavern who claimed to have invented the monkey traffic light and ask them for a clue.

#### Bucan Ville's Town Center

The streets of the Town Center are deserted at night, the gas lamps are lit, and the shops are closed—all except the _**souvenir shop**_ with its large neon sign that reads "Open 24 Hours."

To cross the street that runs through the center, you have to go through a pedestrian crossing controlled by a _**monkey-traffic light**_ and watched over by a _**city guard**_ who only says, "Move along, move along!" The monkey-traffic light is operated by a monkey that changes the color of the light by moving levers. When you approach, the monkey moves the levers, and you always cross on green.

No matter how hard you try, the monkey always sets it to green. The only way to cross on red is to give the monkey a banana when the light is red, and as it eats the banana, it stays red. At that moment you can cross and the _**city guard**_ will give you a _**fine**_ and, therefore, you will be an outlaw.

#### Bucan Ville's Main Square

The Plaza Mayor is like all plazas, a large, empty cobblestone space with a single _**dead tree**_ in the center bearing a sign that reads "Tree for Hanging Pirates - Closed for Renovations."

Next to the tree is a _**painter**_ who is painting the town hall. He paints the pictures at lightning speed and leaves them in a _**pile**_ beside him. If you examine them closely, you'll see they aren't very good.

If you try to talk to him, he'll tell you he's very busy; he has to paint 1,000 identical pictures of the town hall for the fundraising campaign for the governor's reelection.
Next to the town hall is the _**courthouse**_. As you approach, you'll see that it's open from 24:00 to 00:00, except on weekends when it's closed. If you stand to its left before the painter starts a new painting and wait until they finish, you can pick up a painting that shows you next to the courthouse—that is, on the other side of the law, just as the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ requested.

On the other side of the town hall, you can access a _**dark alley**_ from which random snippets of a conversation emerge.

#### Dark alley

It's just a trap. When they enter, the voices will fall silent and figures will vanish into the shadows. As soon as they step back out into the plaza, the voices will return.

### 2.b Get a pirate ship and flag

The only place on the island that sells boats is the _**shipyard**_, and the only one your players can afford right now is a rowboat. The problem is, it's not self-propelled, so they'll have to find a way to make a sail for it.

For the sail fabric, they just need to get the _**Twister vinyl**_ from the _**souvenir shop**_. The mast will simply be one of the oars, and they'll have to tell _**Sam**_, the _**shipyard**_ manager, their idea.

They might waste pixels converting non-clickable elements into clickable ones, like rugs, sheets, etc. When they take it to Sam, he'll make up some silly excuse.

If they present the rowboat's _**title deed**_ to the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ without a sail, they'll fail the test, shouting in unison, "It's not self-propelled!"

The flag isn't a challenge; let them use whatever they find to make their flag, and if you can make it as ridiculous as possible, even better. They can use the discount _**voucher**_ at the _**souvenir shop**_, and the shop assistant can give them any silly thing you can think of to use for their flag.#### Shipyard

From the _**Main Square**_, you can access the Bucan Ville _**shipyards**_, where your players can acquire a boat they can afford.

There they'll find _**Sam**_, a nautical geek with thick glasses and a t-shirt that says, "Kiss me, I'm a model ship builder."

_**Sam**_ lives to design and build ships... to scale (he always says this quietly), and since he hasn't been able to dedicate himself to building them, he sells them.

Despite being a main character and being able to talk about many topics, _**Sam**_ only talks about ships, ship design, the history of navigation, nautical trivia, etc. If you try to talk about something else, he steers the conversation back to ships.
If they tell him they want to buy a ship, he'll offer them what he has in stock: a luxury pirate ship, a second-hand pirate ship, and a fishing boat. When your players explain their financial situation—that is, 0 doubloons—he'll take them to one side of the shipyard and show them an old _**rowboat**_ with a broken oar.

_**Sam**_ will say that the _**luxury pirate ship_** costs so many gold doubloons that only by robbing the _**governor's safe_** could they afford it, but it's pure luxury. In fact, the wheel even has its own ebony coaster. The problem no one saw coming is that when you turn it, it flips over and spills all the drinks.

After tough negotiations, _**Sam**_ will agree to 200 gold doubloons to be paid with their first act of piracy and plunder. He'll give them the _**title deed**_ to the _**rowboat**_ and a _**pile of papers specifying the payment method**_, which they mustn't lose.

To make it self-propelled, they'll need something to serve as a mast and something to serve as a sail. There's a strike by sailmakers and mast makers, and he's out of them, so your players will have to find something to replace it.

As we've already mentioned, for the sail they'll need the _**Twister vinyl**_ decal and for the mast the oar that isn't broken. With these, _**Sam**_ will assemble some sails and change the description on the _**title deed**_.

#### Souvenir shop

_**Maxine**_ the Red, the red-haired terror of the Caribbean, retired from piracy and used her earnings to open a souvenir shop selling famous pirate memorabilia in Bucan Ville. In her shop, you can find the most outlandish items from the pirate world, from a lock of Blackbeard's beard to Sir Francis Drake's mouthguard.

When customers try to buy a clickable item, Maxine will tell some strange story to discourage them, such as that it's riddled with woodworm or belonged to a leper.

The only thing in the shop that could serve as a sail is a _**Twister vinyl**_ Pirate Edition with skulls, crossbones, treasure chests, and cannons instead of the colored circles.

Like most things in her shop, she doesn't want to give the _**Twister vinyl**_ because it reminds him of when he used to "play" (wink, wink, knock, knock) Twister with Anne Bonny, Jack Rackham, and Mary Read aboard the "Ranger."

The _**discount voucher**_ the _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ gave them has a typo, and if you take Lulock Holmes's _**magnifying glass**_ —Lulock Holmes being Sherlock Holmes's Caribbean cousin and the first pirate detective in literature— you can read the fine print. Where it should say, "Presenting this voucher will get you a 50% discount on pirate merchandise OR a 50% discount on board games," it actually says, "Presenting this voucher will get you a 50% discount on pirate merchandise AND a 50% discount on board games."
So they can use the _**discount voucher**_ to get the _**Twister vinyl**_ completely free and Maxine can't refuse because the truth is that it's the most useless and cheapest thing she has in the store.

Ideas for other silly and weird things you might have in the shop that you could add as clickable items, but that Maxine doesn't want to sell because they bring back fond memories:

* Blackbeard's red beard curls
* Sir Francis Drake's dental splint
* Anne Bonny action figure with a karate chop, red-light eyes, and a button that makes her say, "If you had fought like a man, you wouldn't be hanged like a dog now"
* Long John Silver's running peg leg
* Unofficial Pirates of the Caribbean merchandise signed by the main characters' stunt doubles
* A signed and dedicated photo of Ron Gilbert saying not to buy video games over $20.

### 3. You're a Pirate Now

Players can submit proof of their pirate status simultaneously or separately, but until they've fulfilled both requirements and proven it, they won't be considered full-fledged pirates. The _**Pirate Ladybosses**_ will only refer to them as cabin boys and/or landlubbers with mocking laughter.

After acquiring their ship and being on the wrong side of the law, the player characters can apply for their official __**Pirate Certificate**_, which identifies them as pirates, after paying the corresponding fee of one gold doubloon. You can use this as an opportunity to introduce new challenges, such as searching for loose change under the tavern's jukebox.

### 4. Stealing in the Governor's mansion

Throughout the previous scenes, your players will have heard about the governor, his safe, and the vast amounts of money he keeps inside. Since they can't board ships with their rowboat, they'll need to find a way to rob the governor so they can buy a real pirate ship.

When they leave the Boiled Crab Tavern, you can tell them that they can access the governor's house from the harbor. In fact, there's now a giant neon sign at the harbor that reads, "Visit Governor Marlon's Museum, where the magic of democracy happens."

#### Exterior of the Governor's mansion

Governor Marlon's mansion is a Victorian home perched on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean Sea. It is luxurious and well-maintained; surely the upkeep and luxuries, such as the _**equestrian statue of Governor Marlon**_, are paid for with the taxes of all the residents of Bucan Ville.
Examinando su estatua, el gobernador Marlon es un excelente ejemplar de ser humano, larga melena, mentón cincelado con un hoyuelo divino, grandes hombros, torso esculpido en piedra y poderosos brazos y piernas.

El exterior está vigilado por unos _**pavos reales**_ que gluglutean muy alto en cuanto te ven. Entonces una luz de la segunda planta se enciende y el gobernador Marlon sale a la ventana a vigilar armado con un rifle de pólvora negra. Cuando no ve nada sospechoso se vuelve a meter.

Si te escondes detrás de la _**estatua ecuestre**_ y les golpeas cuando no miran hacia donde estás, puedes quitarles una _**pluma**_. Cuando tienes tres plumas, puedes hacerte un _**tocado de pavo real**_ y los _**pavos reales**_ te consideran uno de los suyos y te dejan pasar sin avisar al gobernador.

#### Hall principal de la casa del gobernador

Al entrar a la casa del gobernador se accede al hall principal. Es grande y lujoso, lleno de obras de arte, jarrones caros, figuras de marfil, etc. El _**hall**_ está levemente iluminado por unas pocas _**velas de la una gran lámpara de araña**_.

Si tratan de Tirar/Empujar las _**poleas que suben y bajan la lámpara**_, estas chirriarán y se verán luces desde el piso superior y sonidos del gobernador Marlon cargando su rifle. Eso hace que sea imposible bajar la lámpara mientras haga ruido, necesitan algún tipo de lubricante.

Déjales que busque por las pantallas algo que no sea clicables y que sirva de lubricante, como el grog que beben las _**Jefas Piratas**_, el aguarrás que usa el _**pintor**_ de la _**Plaza Mayor**_, etc. y que lo conviertan en clicable con sus píxeles.

##### Sótano de la casa del gobernador

En el sótano está oscuro y solo se vislumbra la gran puerta de la _**caja fuerte**_ con un montón de cerraduras, ruedas con combinaciones y engranajes para girar. Parece muy complicada, tan complicada que el gobernador Marlon ha dejado una nota escondida en un pixel exacto de la pantalla con las instrucciones para abrir la caja fuerte.

Hay muy poca luz en el sótano y solo podrán encontrar el píxel exacto, si consiguen luz. La única fuente de luz será las _**velas de la lámpara de araña**_ del _**hall principal**_. Si intentan traer alguna fuente de luz de otro sitio (convirtiendo algo en clicable), pónselo difícil, porque serán eléctricas o a gas.

### 5. Enter DraChuckla

Once they've managed to break into the governor's vault and are swimming in gold and jewels, they'll hear a loud cannon blast, and suddenly a cannonball will shatter one of the walls.

As they recover from the explosion, they'll see the fearsome vampire captain DraChuckla enter through the hole with his ghoul henchmen to seize their loot while laughing at them.
He'll approach the player characters, pluck a hair from each of them, and stick them to voodoo dolls, saying, "Just in case you become a problem," and then they'll fall unconscious.

When they manage to get up, they'll see through the hole in the wall that the black-sailed ship that was in the distance from the port is sailing away with DraChuckla on board and Governor Marlon bound and gagged.## Resumen del disquete I

## Floppy disk 2/3: Mighty voodoo magic

En esta segunda parte tus jugadoras tendrán que superar otras 3 escenas. La primera será una escena rápida en que las _**Jefas Piratas**_ les encarguen rescatar al Gobernador Marlon, ya que les debe mucha pasta por trabajos que han estado haciendo para su próxima campaña electoral. Por suerte les dejarán un barco cochambroso que usan para espectáculos para turistas.

En una segunda escena, tendrán que adentrarse en los pantanos de la Isla para encontrarse a _**Alfonsé**_, el conde vudú de los pantanos, para que les explique cómo pueden acabar con DraChuckla y como llegar a la Península del Simio donde se supone que está el temible vampirata buscando el _**Mac’n Cheese**_.

Según _**Alfonsé**_, la única forma de acabar con el capitán DraChuckla es usando la _**cruz de Coronado**_ que es parte del tesoro del _**Mac’n Cheese**_. Así que tendrán que encontrar el tesoro antes que su terrible enemigo.

En la tercera y última escena deberán atravesar el mar Caribe para llegar a la _**Península del Simio**_ siguiendo los designios de los _**huesos del oráculo**_ que les ha dado el conde del vudú.

### 1. Mi primer barco pirata

¿Y ahora qué? Vuestro plan de robar al gobernador se ha ido al garete, así que habrá que buscarse un plan B.
[![Glowing Horizons By Fatbeard91](./images/glowing_horizons_by_fatbeard91_dhqf00b-414w-2x.jpg "Glowing Horizons By Fatbeard91")](https://www.deviantart.com/fatbeard91/art/Glowing-Horizons-1072294859 "Glowing Horizons By Fatbeard91")
Recuérdales lo que decía tu viejo tío Vizzini «Si algo sale mal, vuelve al principio». Así que deberían ir al _**Cangrejo Cocido**_ a ver que se rumorea entre los parroquianos de la taberna.

#### La taberna del Cangrejo Cocido

El Cangrejo Cocido sigue igual de sucio y mugriento y al fondo las 3 _**Jefas Piratas**_ hablan entre ellas. Parece ser que han estado haciendo «trabajos» para el gobernador Marlon precampaña electoral y todavía no los han cobrado con lo que les interesa salvar al secuestrado gobernador y el dinero que robó DraChuckla.

En cuanto les vean acercarse verán una posibilidad de encasquetarle el marrón a unas pobres incautas, tus jugadoras. Así que con mucha verborrea, les ofrecerán un barco de verdad para sus piraterías, si aceptan rescatar al gobernador y recuperar el dinero perdido.

Sacarán un _**contrato por obra y servicio**_ con una letra superpequeña, que solo podrían ver con la _**lupa de Lulock Holmes**_ que tiene _**Maxine la roja**_ en su _**tienda de souvenirs**_ y que no les dejará sacar, pero puede ser divertido que lo intenten hasta que se aburran y firme el contrato.

El contrato estipula que deben salvar al gobernador y sus riquezas de las garras de DraChuckla que actualmente se encuentra en la perdida Península del Simio (perdida porque nadie sabe ir).

Para animarles a firmar, les contarán que puede que encuentren el mítico tesoro, el Mac’n Cheese, ya que DraChuckla lo busca ahora mismo en la península y si encuentran al vampirata, igual de rebote encuentran el tesoro.

Como consejo final les dirán que vayan a hablar con el conde del vudú _**Alfonsé**_ en el _**pantano**_ para más información sobre DraChuckla y la Península del Simio.

En una esquina hay un chaval joven muy borracho con una camiseta que pone «¿Problemas? Alfonsé, el conde vudú, es la solución». Parece un _**repartidor de folletos**_ que trabaja para Alfonsé.

#### El vómito del Kraken

Ahora podrán encontrar en el _**puerto**_ el _**Vómito del Kraken**_, el barco pirata que las 3 _**Jefas Piratas**_ les han entregado. A lo lejos parece tener una pinta impresionante, pero cuando suban a él verán que todo es cartón y trampa. De hecho, solo han pintado un lado del barco porque es el único que ven los turistas cuando pasa a lo lejos.

En la cubierta principal se encontrarán con la _**Señorita Bridalis**_. _**Bridalis**_ trabaja para la «Comisión por el desarrollo turístico de Bucan Ville», dependiente del «Gremio de Piratas de Bucan Ville», dirigido a su vez por las _**Jefas Piratas**_. _**Bridalis**_ se encarga del mantenimiento del barco y de hacer los shows piratas para los turistas que visitan la isla.
Durante los shows _**Bridalis**_ se mueve superrápido, se cambia de traje y pone voces, de manera que desde el exterior parece que el barco está lleno de tripulantes, pero solo está pilotado por ella. Tienes varios piratas famosos que sabe imitar a la perfección y de los que tiene un buen disfraz.

Habla con muchísimo acento pirata y está tan metida en el papel que, si no le hablas con igual acento, no te entiende.

_**Bridalis**_ les dirá que tiene el barco preparado para zarpar, pero antes deberían averiguar o conseguir alguna pista sobre donde está la Península del Simio. Tal vez el poderoso conde vudú _**Alfonsé**_ que vive en el pantano pueda ayudarles. A su madre le hizo desaparecer una verruga con pelos que tenía en la espalda, así que su eficacia como brujo está probada.

### 2. La senda del vudú

La única manera de llegar a choza de _**Alfonsé**_ es conseguir uno de sus panfletos publicitarios que explica como llegar. El problema es que el _**repartidor**_ que ha contratado los ha repartido ya todos y no puede dar ninguno a tus jugadoras. En realidad los ha tirado todos en el pantano y se ha ido a empapuzarse de grog de bañera en el _**Cangrejo Cocido**_.

Por mucho que busquen, no van a encontrar _**panfletos de publicidad de Alfonsé**_, solo hay uno y está en la _**tienda souvenirs**_.

#### Tienda de souvenirs

El único _**panfleto**_ que pueden conseguir ahora mismo es uno que le firmo el famoso pirata François «El Olones» a _**Maxine la roja**_. Esta lo guarda en una vitrina de su _**tienda de souvenirs**_ como oro en paño. No quiere desprenderse de él.

Si les quedan e intentan algún truco con los _**vales de descuento**_, les enseñará que ya han caducado y no pueden usarlos.

La única forma de que les dé el _**folleto**_ es que les consiga una foto firmada de otro gran pirata, para lo que les dará una [cámara de fotos Polaroid](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1mara_instant%C3%A1nea). Y la única manera de conseguir la foto de un pirata famoso es hacer que _**Bridalis**_ se ponga uno de sus disfraces de piratas famosos y luego firme la foto. Se mete tanto en el personaje que incluso sabe firmar como ellos.

Según entreguen la foto, _**Maxine**_ debería inventarse alguna historia escabrosa/picante que tuvo con el personaje fotografiado.

Si se ponen ingeniosas, igual pueden convencer a _**Alfonsé**_, el conde del vudú, para que les haga una sesión de espiritismo con alguna pirata famosa y que les firme algo poseyendo al médium.
#### El pantano

El pantano es un laberinto que es imposible atravesar sin las indicaciones adecuadas, es decir, el _**folleto de Alfonsé**_. Si entran sin el folleto se moverán por 3 pantallas con 4 salidas para terminar saliendo del pantano.

**No hay nada en el pantano que indique el camino**, pero si quieres tenerlos entretenidos, mete alguna pista falsa. Puedes meter una hierba de cierto color especial en alguno de los caminos o un cocodrilo que se escapa por una salida cuando entran los jugadores. Tratarán de encontrarle la lógica y de reproducirla.

Si tienen el _**folleto**_, simplemente tendrán que seguir las indicaciones del folleto. Serán 3 direcciones, Norte (arriba), Sur (abajo), Este (derecha) y Oeste (izquierda). A la cuarta pantalla llegarán a la _**guarida de Alfonsé**_.

Si quieres complicárselo, podrías hacer que cuando entren en cualquier pantalla del pantano lo hagan por la derecha y que las indicaciones tengan que ser en referencia a la entrada. Es decir, si la primera se meten por el norte (arriba), aparecerán por la derecha con lo que el norte estaría saliendo por la izquierda en vez de saliendo por arriba y este estaría arriba, oeste abajo y sur por donde han venido.

Tus jugadoras pueden pensar fuera de la caja y querer quitarle la borrachera al _**repartidor de publicidad**_ para que les diga el camino a la _**guarida**_. Es una opción interesante y puedes hacer que, por ejemplo, _**Sam**_ tenga una jarra gigante de café en el _**astillero**_.

#### La guarida de Alfonsé

Al salir del pantano llegarán a una de marjales tan frondosos que casi no dejan pasar la luz. En un trono con forma de calavera y rodeado de velas encendidas, incensarios y montones de quincallería vudú está _**Alfonsé**_, el conde vudú de los pantanos. Es un poderoso brujo que puede convertir a tus jugadoras en gallina durante unos segundos, si son descorteses con él.

Es muy fantasma y le gusta darse mucho bombo con sus poderes vudú, que si no hay nadie con sus poderes y conocimientos, que él solo podría con DraChuckla, pero entonces dejaría sin vigilancia Bucan Ville, que si podría encontrar el _**Mac’n Cheese**_, pero a él no le mueve el dinero, etc.

Tras dar muchas vueltas y vueltas a la conversación, si son persistentes, le sacarán toda la info necesaria:

* Para matar a DraChuckla necesitan la _**cruz de Coronado**_, una cruz de oro y joyas de gran valor que se supone que forma parte del _**Mac’n Cheese**_.
* Todo el mundo sabe que el _**Mac’n Cheese**_ está escondido en la península del Simio, el problema es encontrar la península. Para encontrarla debes usar los _**huesos vudú**_ y resolver su misterio.
* La única manera de contrarrestar los muñecos vudú que hizo DraChuckla de ellas es destruirlas.
Como ya hemos dicho, si tus jugadoras son descorteses, puede convertirlas en gallina durante unos minutos. La _**gallina**_ puede meterse en el equipo y al poco de sacarse se volverá a convertirse en persona. Seguramente traten de solucionar algún reto con esta opción y si son creativos podrían usarlo.

El conde del vudú hace mucho hincapié en que los _**huesos**_ son «huesos del oráculo» no «huesos oráculo» (guiño, guiño, golpe, golpe). Vamos, que son huesos humanos, exactamente de un vidente llamado Tom «el bidente» por tener solo dos dientes.

Como anécdota, al principio de la pantalla hay un cubo de basura lleno de panfletos de Alfonsé que ha tirado allí el _**repartidor**_.

### 3. En mareas extrañas

Esta escena es un puzzle en el que deberán usar los _**huesos del oráculo**_. Los huesos son 9 dados de 6 caras con puntos en vez de números. Para invocar al oráculo deben conseguir la siguiente figura que representa una calavera. En ese momento aparecerá el oráculo y les guiará a la península del simio.

La DJ debe tirar los dados y formar una cuadrícula de 3x3. Las jugadoras deben decir cuantos movimientos deben hacer para conseguir el dibujo.
Un movimiento consiste en mover un dado a una cara y girar 90 grados un dado. Luego deberán conseguir dibujar la calavera con el número exacto de movimiento. Pueden deshacer un movimiento gastando un píxel.

![Huesos del oráculo](./images/huesos.png)

Si lo consiguen los huesos tomarán vida y _**Tom «el bidente»**_ empezará a hablar. Habla como un genio de la lámpara con expresiones como «Lo que ordene mi ama y señora» o «Como deseéis».

_**Tom «el bidente»**_ puede contestar a 3 preguntas, una la van a gastar en saber las coordenadas de la península del Simio, las otras dos para lo que quieran. Pero solo podrá responder mientras sus huesos estén en posición. En cuanto se separen o muevan los dados, el oráculo se desvanecerá y no podrá volver a ser invocado.

Si siguen las coordenadas que les dé _**Tom «el bidente»**_, conseguirán llegar a la península del Simio. A partir de este momento podrán venir siempre que quieran.## Resumen del disquete II

_Nuevas ubicaciones en naranja_## Floppy disk 3/3: At the Ape Peninsula

Tus jugadoras han conseguido llegar a la península del Simio y van a descubrir que cerca está fondeado en una pequeña cala «El caminante», el barco de DraChuckla. Así que deberán buscarse otro sitio donde desembarcar.

En este tercer disquete, deberán recorrer las 3 últimas escenas. Primero deberán encontrar el _**Mac’n Cheese**_ antes que el capitán DraChuckla y conseguir la _**Cruz de Coronado**_.

Posteriormente, en la segunda escena, deberán infiltrarse en _**El Caminante**_, el barco zombi del DraChuckla, y recuperar sus _**muñecos vudús**_, ya que con ellos en poder de su enemigo, están indefensos antes la poderosa magia del malvado capitán vampirata.

Por último, deberán enfrentarse en singular combate con DraChuckla y usar la Cruz de Coronado para darle muerte, pero una muerte muerte. Aquí no queremos segundas partes, ¿o sí?

### 1. La excavación

Tus jugadoras han llegado a la costa de la península del Simio y lo primero es encontrar el gran tesoro pirata y conseguir la _**cruz de Coronado**_.
[![Silence By Fatbeard91](./images/silence_by_fatbeard91_dfvdlmr-414w-2x.jpg "Silence By Fatbeard91")](https://www.deviantart.com/fatbeard91/art/Silence-959695299 "Silence By Fatbeard91")
Lo primero será encontrar la cueva donde está el tesoro sin perderse en el laberinto de la jungla. Y esta vez no habrá mapa como con el pantano. Deberán descubrir la clave, que son unos doblones en un pixel exacto que marcan la ruta.

Para acceder al tesoro, que está al fondo de la cueva, deberán pasar por 3 pantallas y en cada una de ellas solucionar un pequeño puzzle.

En el fondo de la cueva, encima de una montaña de _**lingotes de oro**_, está la _**cruz de Coronado**_, pero escalar el montón de _**lingotes**_ y coger la cruz será otro reto.

> Si quieres simplificar las cosas puedes hacer que _**El Caminante**_ hunda el barco de tus jugadoras, _**El vómito del Kraken**_, de forma que no puedan salir de la península. Así evitas que se vuelvan locos intentando cosas en _**Bucan Ville**_ para usarla en esta parte.

#### La playa

Tus jugadoras junto con _**Bridalis**_ van a desembarcar en la _**playa**_. La _**playa**_ es paradisíaca, con arena y palmeras, perfecta para broncearse al sol tumbado en la arena y tomando grog. Puede recoger algas del suelo, aunque están secas y son malolientes. Mientras tus jugadoras se adentran en la jungla, _**Bridalis**_ se quedará en la playa cuidando la _**barca**_.

Cada vez que entren en la pantalla, _**Bridalis**_ tendrá un nuevo disfraz y estará haciendo alguna de estas actividades:

* Hacer un castillo de arena
* Broncearse al sol
* Jugar con una pelota de playa
* Salir del agua con traje de submarinismo
* Pescar con caña
* Hacer una barbacoa
* Con un detector de metales buscando monedas

Si las ves muy perdidas puedes darles, alguno de los objetos que está usando _**Bridalis**_, por ejemplo, el detector de metales puede ayudarles en la jungla. También puedes llenarles el equipo de mierdas que no van a necesitar ni poder usar.

Si usan la _**barca**_ podrán volver al _**Vómito de Kraken**_ y de ahí a _**Bucan Ville**_.

#### La jungla

La oscura jungla es un auténtico laberinto. Como en el pantano se moverán por zonas de jungla con conexiones arriba, abajo, izquierda y derecha. Tras moverse por 4 zonas volverán a la playa.

La única manera de atravesar el laberinto es seguir el rastro de _**doblones de oro**_ que marcan la ruta hacia la _**caverna del tesoro**_. Los _**doblones**_ están escondidos en píxeles exactos. Si tienen algún tipo de detector de metales, puedes darles bonus en la búsqueda del píxel exacto.

Si encuentran los 4 doblones y siguen sus indicaciones, llegarán a la _**entrada de la caverna**_.
A partir de ese momento, cuando entren en la jungla, llegarán directamente a la _**entrada de la cueva**_.

#### Entrada de la cueva del tesoro

La _**entrada de la cueva**_ es una gigantesca cabeza de simio de piedra y está guardada por un _**montón de simios**_ que te gruñen y lanzan cacas si te acercas.

Si se fijan bien, los _**simios**_ lanzan las cacas siempre en las 3 mismas zonas y antes de lanzar gruñen. Las cacas al caer salpican, así que las zonas donde se pueden pringar son amplias.

Después de cada ronda de lanzamiento de cacas, mientras consiguen nueva munición (tómatelo como quieras), tus jugadoras pueden atravesar una zona de salpicadura y quedarse en una zona protegida.

Así, poco a poco podrán avanzar hacia la cabeza de mono y una vez estén enfrente de los _**simios**_ huirán despavoridos.

Puedes pedirles tiradas para recordar con precisión si están en zona de pringue o no. Dales bonus si se les ocurre dejar algo para marcarlas como papeles y negativos si intentan pasar a toda velocidad.

Si les cae una caca encima a una de tus jugadoras, saldrá corriendo a la playa a limpiarse y con ella sus compañeras. Recuerda que no pueden separarse y deben estar siempre en la misma pantalla.

Las cacas una vez impactan desaparecen sin dejar pistas de donde están las zonas de caída de cacas.

#### Primera cámara de la cueva

En esta _**primera cámara**_ hay tres _**estatuas de simios**_, cada una con un gesto, uno que se tapa las orejas, otro la boca y otro los ojos. Encima de cada una las _**estatuas**_ hay un pequeño simio que imita cualquier gesto. Si avanzan y algún simio no es igual al gesto de su estatua, en cuanto pasan las _**3 estatuas**_, los simios tocan algún resorte y se levanta un muro que no les deja avanzar.

Los monos imitan lo que hace la persona que hay delante de la estatua, así que, por ejemplo, al ponerse delante del que tiene tapadas las orejas y taparse los ojos, se taparán los ojos. Automáticamente, el resto cambian siguiendo estás reglas.

* Si cambian la primera estatua o tercera estatua, el gesto actual pasa a la estatua de que no tenga el gesto al que queremos cambiar y gesto que no hemos cambiado ocupa el lugar libre.
* Si cambian el gesto de la segunda estatua solo se intercambia por el nuevo gesto.

La solución es sencilla, pero hay que descubrir el movimiento de los gestos.

|&nbsp;|1ª estatua|2ª estatua|3ª estatua|
|---|---|---|---|
|Gesto estatua|Orejas|Boca|Ojos|
|Gesto simio inicial|Ojos|Boca|Orejas|
|1ª estatua **orejas**|**Orejas**|Ojos|Boca|
|3ª estatua **ojos**|Boca|Orejas|**Ojos**|
|2ª estatua **boca**|Orejas|**Boca**|Ojos|
Si colocan cada simio en su estatua, no saltará el muro y podrán avanzar. Los gestos se conservan aunque salgan de la pantalla.

#### Segunda cámara de la cueva

En la segunda cámara hay un gran precipicio y hay un _**tronco**_ que parece ser demasiado corto para hacer una pasarela con la que pasar por encima del precipicio. Las soluciones pueden ser muy varias.

* Lo más sencillo es meterle al _**tronco**_ todos sus píxeles para hacer que sea más largo.
* Pueden mirar en su equipo y atar algo para que _**tronco**_ sea más largo, pero en principio no deberían tener nada que sirva.
* El precipicio es muy poco hondo, pero como el fondo queda fuera de pantalla parece que no tiene fin. Si lanzan algo verán que no es nada hondo, apenas les llega a las rodillas. Pueden bajar, pasar andando y volver a subir por el otro lado.
* Si quieren hacer un poco de metajuego de videojuego, pueden poner el _**tronco**_ verticalmente y podrían trepar y acceder a la parte superior de la interfaz gráfico y cruzar el precipicio usando la interfaz de puente. Una vez pasen el precipicio podrán descolgarse de la interfaz.

#### Tercera cámara de la cueva

La _**tercera cámara**_ es un largo pasillo en el que parece que no hay nada, pero cuando vayan a atravesarla saldrá una _**cuchilla gigante del techo**_ que estará a punto de cortarles por la mitad y no podrán pasar al otro lado.

Cuando se activa la _**cuchilla**_ se oye un chillido de mono que sale de una _**agujero en la pared**_ más adelante, así que seguro que un mono vigila desde esa trampilla y activa la _**cuchilla**_. No puede acercarse al _**agujero**_ porque la _**cuchilla**_ salta, así que no pueden hacerle nada al simio.

El pasillo es tan largo que hay scroll en la pantalla de izquierda a derecha y el truco de esta pantalla está en usar ese scroll para atravesar la cuchilla.

Si tus jugadoras van juntas, van en el centro de la pantalla y cuando llegan al punto donde está la _**cuchilla**_ el _**agujero del simio**_ está en pantalla y el vigía los ve y activa la cuchilla.

Si van avanzando, una jugadora en cada lado de la pantalla, cuando la de la derecha llega a la cuchilla, la _**trampilla del mono**_ vigía no está en pantalla (ya que la otra jugadora mueve el scroll hacia su lado), por tanto, no los ve y no puede activar la _**cuchilla**_.

Una vez ha pasado una jugadora la cuchilla, podrá espantar al mono de la _**trampilla**_ y que pasen el resto.

Igual si vuelven a hablar con el creador del simio-semáforo y les dé una pista de cómo funciona la _**simio-cuchilla**_.
#### Cámara del tesoro

En esta gran sala hay montañas de monedas de oro, cetros y coronas enjoyadas y diamantes, rubíes y esmeraldas como melones. Pueden llenar todo su equipo con _**riquezas**_ de todo tipo si lo desean.

Han encontrado el gran tesoro pirata, pero conseguir la _**cruz de Coronado**_ no es tarea fácil. Encima de una montaña de lingotes de oro está la _**cruz**_, pero si intentan escalar la _**montaña de lingotes**_ para cogerla, resbalan y te caes al pie de la montaña.

A priori, necesitan algún tipo de equipo de escalada o algún tipo de invento que les permita coger la _**cruz**_ a distancia, pero nada más lejos de la realidad.

La única opción es que cojan los _**lingotes**_ de la montaña y las metan en su equipo para hacer más pequeña la montaña y puedan escalarla fácilmente. Necesitarán por lo menos quitar 20 casillas de equipo de _**lingotes**_ para que disminuya a un nivel adecuado. El problema es que con todo ese oro es muy imposible moverse, con coger 1 lingote no podrán moverse y no podrán trepar. Si lo tiran, volverá al montón y este volverá a crecer y no se podrá escalar.

El truco de esta prueba es dar los _**lingotes**_ a una compañera que este al otro lado de la jugadora y esta lo tire al otro lado de manera que los _**lingotes**_ crean otro montón, de esa manera la primera jugadora se puede mover y coger la _**cruz**_.

### 2. De vampiros y zombis

Con la cruz en su poder, la siguiente parte es ir a enfrentarse a DraChuckla, pero primero deben recuperar sus _**muñecos vudú**_. Tus jugadoras pueden ir directamente a enfrentarse a DraChuckla sin haber recuperado sus _**muñecos vudú**_, pero nada más verlos llamara a un zombi que entrará con los muñecos y empezará a atravesarlos con unas agujas, con lo que tendrán que salir corriendo y aparecerán fuera del navío. Tendrán que volver a empezar la infiltración en el barco desde el principio.

De vuelta a la playa, tras tener en su mano la _**cruz de Coronado**_, podrán usar el bote con el que han bajado a tierra. Podrán salir de la cala en la que está su barco e ir al lugar donde fondea _**El caminante**_, el navío de velas negras de DraChuckla.

Esta escena se desarrollará en _**El caminante**_. Como rey de los no-muertos, DraChuckla ha convertido en zombis a todas sus víctimas y los ha enrolado en su tripulación. No son muy eficientes ni rápidos, pero son difíciles de matar, no necesitan agua, ni comida, ni cobrar a fin de mes. Así que todo son ventajas.

Si los _**no-muertos**_ los detectan, se lanzarán a por ellos y tendrán que salir del barco y volver a empezar la escena desde el principio, igual que cuando _**DraChuckla**_ usa los muñecos vudú.
#### Fuera de El caminante

Tus jugadoras pueden acercarse al casco de _**El caminante**_ cerca de su ancla, que han dejado caer al mar. El casco está cubierto de _**percebes, lapas y mejillones**_ que pueden recolectarse.

No hay ningún tipo de prueba o reto en esta pantalla, simplemente escalar la _**cadena del ancla**_ y entrar a la _**cubierta inferior**_.

#### Cubierta inferior

La _**cubierta inferior**_ está llena de zombis vagando de un lado al otro. La pantalla tiene un scroll muy largo. La escotilla que han usado para entrar está a un lado de la cubierta y la escalera para subir está al otro lado.

Los _**zombis**_ solo dicen las típicas frases de zombi, como «Cerebro ricooooo», «Chomp chomp» o «Maaaaaaaa», y no paran de moverse aleatoriamente por toda la cubierta. 

Los zombis están sucios y apestosos, así que si son listos podrían embadurnarse con las _**lapas, percebes y mejillones**_ del casco y hacerse algún tipo de disfraz de algas de la _**playa**_. Con esto, los _**zombis**_ de la cubierta inferior no deberían molestarlas.

#### Cubierta superior

La _**cubierta superior**_ está también llena de _**zombis**_, pero estos parecen más inteligentes, están haciendo tareas sencillas como barrer la cubierta o atar y desatar cabos.

Esta pantalla también es larga con un scroll desde la escalera que subía de la _**cubierta inferior**_ hasta la puerta del _**castillo de popa**_.

Esta vez no bastará con ponerse los restos malolientes del marisco de casco, deberán coger algo como _**una fregona**_ o un _**cepillo**_ y limpiar el suelo o coger una _**maroma**_ y llevarlas al otro lado de la cubierta.

Hazles pasar una tirada para engañar a los _**zombis de cubierta**_ y puedes darles positivos o negativos según su interpretación, si hacen sonidos de zombis o hablan como humanos, etc.

#### Castillo de popa

El castillo de popa es una estancia que hace las veces de almacén de trastos, mapas, herramientas de navegación, trofeos varios y toda la parafernalia vudú de DraChuckla como _**cabezas reducidas parlantes**_ o los _**muñecos vudú**_ de tus jugadoras. En una esquina hay un camastro para el _**primer oficial zombi**_ y un baúl donde están sus cosas. 

La misión en esta pantalla es coger los _**muñecos vudú**_ para que cuando _**DraChuckla**_ quiera usarlos no pueda. Los muñecos están en una _**vitrina de exposición con cerrojo**_ con otros objetos vudús. El problema es que cuando intentas abrir la _**vitrina**_, _**3 cabezas reducidas parlantes**_ que hay encima de la _**vitrina**_ empiezan a chillar y todo se llena de zombis, con lo que tus jugadoras se tiran al agua por una escotilla para escapar.
Puede hacerse de varias maneras.

* La más sencilla es coger las cabezas (tendrán que coger una cada vez) porque al momento el resto se ponen a gritar y aparecen los zombis. Cuando tengan todas, podrán abrir la _**vitrina**_ sin que suene ninguna alarma.
* Podrían hacer sonar las alarmas montones de veces y largarse rápidamente antes de que les vean. De esta manera, el _**primero de abordo**_ terminará hartándose y quitando las _**cabezas**_ para que no griten. Pon un número de falsas alarmas y hasta que no lo completen no las quitará el _**primero de abordo**_.

Por si tienen alguna idea genial y/o mirando su equipo inventan algún tipo de artilugio para robar los muñecos, debes tener en cuenta que si tocan el _**cerrojo**_, las _**cabezas**_ dan la alarma y si tocan propias _**cabezas**_, también dan la alarma.

Con los muñecos en su poder podrán entrar en el _**camarote de DraChuckla**_ y enfrentarse a él sin miedo.

### 3. ¡Muere maldito vampirata!

Esta escena es la batalla final contra el terrible _**DraChuckla**_. La batalla es un duelo de ingenio y habilidad sin parangón que pondrá a prueba todas las capacidades de tus jugadoras ... Qué va, mentira. Va a ser una cinemática chusca y pista, que los disquetes están caros.

#### Camarote de DraChuckla

_**DraChuckla**_ les espera tocándole al _**Gobernador Marlon**_ una de sus piezas musicales tremendamente tétrica en un gigantesco órgano en su camarote. Viste su capa de vampiro que tiene un vuelo estupendo y va con su gorro de capitán pirata. El _**gobernador**_ está atacado y amordazado

Cuando entren, llamará a su _**primero de a bordo zombi**_ para que les traiga los _**muñecos vudú**_ y acabar con tus jugadoras, pero si han hecho bien los deberes, el _**primero de abordo**_ aparecerá y le dirá «Mi señor, los muñecos no están».

Aquí empezará la batalla entre jugadoras y el temible capitán DraChuckla. Puedes enfocarlo como quieras, pero la idea que te ofrecemos es que sea una especie de cinemática donde DraChuckla se acerca a tus jugadoras soltando amenazas tipo «Voy a chuparos la sangre» o «Me daré un festín con vuestra vitae». Ellas sacarán la _**cruz de Coronado**_ que empieza a brillar. La luz que emite la _**cruz**_ quema al vampiro que empieza a convertirse en cenizas y muere. 

Si quieres pueden quitar el monólogo y poner un diálogo con zascas entre DraChuckla y tus jugadoras. Si le dan buenas réplicas, se irá enfadando y acercando hasta ponerse cerca y poder sacar la _**cruz**_.

Otra opción tremendamente insatisfactoria, es que tengan que sacar la cruz en el momento justo. Si lo sacan antes de tiempo, DraChuckla saldrá volando sin haberlo podido matar. Si lo hacen demasiado tarde, se cubrirá con su capa y les quitará la cruz de un manotazo para proceder a convertirlas en sus esclavos zombis.
### 4. Final Scene

After defeating DraChuckla and freeing the governor, you can return to Bucan Ville where you'll be welcomed as heroines by the citizens. If you've collected any treasure, you'll return rich.

The governor will promise you a political position if you help him get re-elected, and you'll see that the governor is exactly as he appeared in his equestrian statue.

There will be music, parties, dancing, and grog galore, culminating in fireworks that no one knows where they came from. Let each player say a solemn phrase as the fireworks explode, and…

Suddenly, the screen will shift back to DraChuckla's cabin where his ashes will begin to glow while eerie organ music plays, before transitioning to the adventure's credits and a «The End».

> If your players ask you at the end of the adventure what the enigma of the Monkey Peninsula is, you can tell them that the enigma is that it is actually an island, something that was already mentioned in the introduction of the adventure.
