_Deep in the Caribbean lies a peninsula surrounded by water on all sides, called the Ape Peninsula. Venture into its dark grottoes, dense jungles, and well-stocked gift and souvenir shops to become a true buccaneer._

_You'll have to face zombie ships, vampire pirate captains, talking shrunken heads, and plenty of apes, using your intelligence, your wit, and the powerful, sometimes explosive, magic of voodoo._

_If you're lucky enough to avoid scurvy, you might just survive this adventure and find the greatest pirate treasure ever known, Mac’n Cheese, earning the respect of the entire Caribbean._

## The enigma of the Ape Peninsula

\conc

«The enigma of the Ape Peninsula» is a graphic adventure game for EGA, available on three 3.5-inch floppy disks. Its theme is humor and fantasy, and it was developed by LucasArts Games. To play this adventure, you only need the [Basic Rules for «Point and Click RPG»](https://pointnclick.gwannon.com/).

The first part of this adventure (Disk 1) is the introductory adventure included in the basic rules, so if you've already played it, you can skip it.

### Special rules

#### Look behind you… A three-tailed ape!

Once per game session, one of your players can spend 2 pixels and use the "Look behind you… A three-tailed ape!" trick. After saying the phrase, the player must roll a d6.

On a roll of 6, the other target turns around to face the three-tailed ape, and all players can perform an action, such as picking up something the target was holding, fleeing, or going through a door.

This trick only works with NPCs you can talk to, and it always fails when there is actually a three-tailed ape behind you.
