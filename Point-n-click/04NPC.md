## Non-player character

&nbsp;

\conc

There is a special type of clickable item called non-player characters (NPCs). There are three types of NPCs:

* **Monophrase:** They only have one line and appear in only one scene.
* **Multiphrases:** They have several lines with an important clue, can appear in different scenes, and can give or receive items.
* **Main characters:** Key characters with many lines, appear in many scenes, and constantly give clues and equipment.

> These types are not fixed; a monophrase character can become a multiphrase character later in the adventure.

### Monophrase
These characters are the simplest in the Game Guides and only have one line they utter when you try to talk to them. They usually say silly things or jokes, and in a few cases, they offer a very cryptic clue. Some have a simple movement routine, like walking from one point to another or pushing a large stone block.

Recording the line they're going to say is enough. Aside from uttering their line, they're not much else to use.

Some of them, especially those with movement capabilities, can be used as clickable items to solve a challenge or puzzle. For example, you could smear grease on a monophrase character so that seagulls attack it, causing it to drop its oil barrel and make another, more important NPC slip.

#### Old lady with walker (monophrase)

Her only sentence is, «Have you thought about adding more fiber to your diet?» She moves slowly with his walker, and when you enter her screen, she's at a random point.

#### Dog with a bone (monophrase)

Him stands next to a blind beggar on the main street. His only utterance is «Grrrrr» when you approach the blind man's donations or try to take the bone from his feet. Perhaps you can distract him with a steak, a cat, or a ball.

### Multiphrases

These characters are **more complex** than the previous ones, with more dialogue, items they can give or receive, and some movement patterns. 

\sp

They will likely have a task, such as providing information on a certain matter, preventing access to a specific area, or preventing the acquisition of certain items.

Rather than specific dialogue, you should choose a couple of topics they know a lot about and could discuss with the player characters, as well as the key information they can provide.

If we need to obtain something from them (information, items, or access), you should note how to do so. This could involve giving them another item, asking them a specific question, or performing a series of actions with nearby clickable objects and/or equipment.

You should also note any weaknesses the players can exploit, which they or other characters will likely mention to the players.

#### Suspicious guy in an alley (multiphrase)

You're walking down the street and suddenly from an alleyway comes a shout: «Hey, you, loser!» You ask, «Me?» and he replies, «Yeah, you, loser!». You go in and there's a suspicious-looking guy with a wide-brimmed hat that hides his face and a long trench coat that covers him to his feet.

Is he a thief about to rob you? A drug dealer, or worse, a Pokémon card dealer? A pervert? You don't know, and it's best not to approach him.

If you do approach him, he's a seller of fun-shaped helium balloons. You can talk to him about various topics: helium balloons, cryptocurrency investments, and Pokémon cards.

If you get him **a extrarare Pokémon card**, he'll give you a bunch of helium balloons that you could use to lift something heavy or fly a few meters. You can also get the balloons with something that looks like cryptocurrency, like the tokens from the laundromat.

### Main characters

They're as complex as your PC, with countless lines of dialogue, their own equipment, and the freedom to move around the screen as they please, appearing in almost every scene. They'll likely be your players' nemesis or characters with significant weight in the story.

If they're the villain, they don't usually have actions that allow you to achieve something, like pushing them to make them drop a coin. Instead, finding a way to defeat them is the challenge of an entire scene, or even a whole part.

It's common for them to start as multiphrases and then become main characters due to a change in the story. Perhaps the street urchin who gives you rumors about the criminal underworld (multiphrase) will be kidnapped by your nemesis and become a main character.

#### Vampirate captain (main character/villain)

[![Flat design pixel art character element collection by freepik](./images/7965103.png "Flat design pixel art character element collection by freepik")](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-design-pixel-art-character-element-collection_33111981.htm "Flat design pixel art character element collection by freepik")

You are facing the terror of the entire Caribbean; uttering his name fills the heart with dread. He is the perfect villain for your adventure. Besides being a pirate captain and a vampire, he wields powerful voodoo magic and owns a zombie ship with its crew of ghoul servants.

His weaknesses are typical of pirates and vampires: grog, gold, and young men and/or young ladies, and sunlight, crosses, holy water, garlic, and young men and/or young ladies. So your players will have to find a way to exploit these weaknesses against him. Perhaps another voodoo user can help them.

Furthermore, with luck, your players might be able to discover whether they is a pirate who was turned into a vampire or a vampire who decided to become a pirate. 

### Interacting with NPCs

When interacting with NPCs, there are a few rules you can follow that will give the game that classic AG flavor:

* You can ask questions as many times as you like; they won't get annoyed and should always give the same answer. The answers will only change if you do something different. Even then, they shouldn't get annoyed.

\sc

* The same applies when you use objects on them. As long as you don't use the right one, nothing should change. If you give them money, they'll simply refuse it. If you throw a bucket of water at them, they'll either move away or get wet and yell at you, but they won't move from the door they're guarding. However, if you take out a mouse and give the doorman a piece of cheese, the mouse will approach, attracted by the smell of cheese, and the NPC will run away, terrified of the rodent.
* Usually, an NPC's trick stops working when you change screens or scenes. If the doorman reappears in another scene, the mouse trick will no longer work, and he'll tell you that his psychoanalyst helped him with that phobia.
* NPCs only participate in one challenge per scene; our doorman's challenge is to infiltrate the mafia's hideout. Once this challenge is completed, he won't provide equipment or clues for other challenges, but this isn't always the case.
